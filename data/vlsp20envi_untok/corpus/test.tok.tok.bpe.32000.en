Coronavirus in Germany : Angela Merkel urges people to stay home ' whenever possible '
Angela Merkel has called for solidarity as Germany enters a " very serious phase " of the pandemic . Germany has again set a new daily case record , as ministers call for thousands of additional contact trac@@ ers .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday urged residents to stay at home amid a dramatic increase in the number of coronavirus infections in Germany .
" We have to do everything we can now to ensure that the virus does not spread uncontrol@@ lab@@ ly — every day counts , " Merkel said in her weekly po@@ d@@ cast .
" I ask you to refrain from any trip that is not really necessary , any celebration that is not really necessary . Please stay at home - wherever you are , whenever possible , " she said .
Merkel said that Germany was currently in the midst of a " very serious phase " of the pandemic , adding that " the number of new infections is increasing by lea@@ ps and b@@ ounds every day . "
" The compar@@ atively relaxed summer is over ; now we are facing difficult months . How winter will be , how our Christmas will be , will be decided in the coming days and weeks . We all decide that through our actions . "
She called on Ger@@ m@@ ans to show solidarity and restr@@ aint , as they did in the early phase of the pandemic .
" What brought us so well through the first half year of the pandemic ? " she asked . " It was that we stood together and o@@ be@@ yed the rules out of consideration and common sense . This is the most effective re@@ med@@ y we currently have against the pandemic and it is more necessary now than ever . "
On Saturday , the Robert Koch Institute for disease control said Germany recorded 7,@@ 8@@ 30 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 - hour period , a new record since the pandemic began .
The number of cases was nearly 500 higher than on Friday and more than 1,500 higher than the prior infection peak recorded in March .
Officials say testing capacity has been greatly expanded since the beginning of the pandemic and that is one of the reasons why the country is seeing a sp@@ ike in infections .
A second wave also appears to be in full swing due to a Europe - wide loo@@ sen@@ ing of restrictions over the summer .
Bra@@ un also noted that the country 's coronavirus tracing app was seeing a " steep rise " in alerts to the public .
By Tuesday , the app had sent warnings to the anonymous contacts of some 10,@@ 8@@ 60 users who had subsequently tested positive for the virus .
The app has been downloaded around 19.@@ 6 million times and experts believe it is being used by around 16 million people .
Bra@@ un also told the regional paper that he is in favor of holding a state ceremony to remember those who have died from COVID - 19 .
He ac@@ knowled@@ ged that relatives of the dead may have not welcomed comments made by ministers over the summer that Germany had come through the health crisis relatively un@@ s@@ ca@@ th@@ ed .
" To them , I say that the victims of this pandemic will not be for@@ gotten under any circumstances . ”
COVID - 19 : What role does blood type play ?
A case of COVID - 19 can be from mild to severe . Sometimes no symptoms are present . Sometimes people die . More and more studies suggest that blood types may play an important role by affecting immune responses .
Why do some people not notice at all that they have contracted the coronavirus , while others require medical treatment — and , in the worst cases , even die ?
That COVID - 19 seems so unpredic@@ table also makes it difficult to find out how many people are actually infected and how many have already built up immunity . The number of un@@ reported cases is correspondingly high .
Al@@ ready in June , German and Norwegian researchers analyzed different blood types with regards to COVID - 19 . They came up with some inform@@ ative results , which they published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
The researchers investigated the role blood type might play in patients with particularly severe forms of the disease .
In the study , the researchers examined 1,6@@ 10 patients with COVID - 19 respiratory failure in Italy and Spain , where the coronavirus hit particularly hard : Milan , Mon@@ za , Madrid , San S@@ eb@@ as@@ tian , and Barcelona . All patients were struggling with particularly severe cases , and some did not survive .
Blood type A means highest risk
A first result : People with blood type A seem to be at a particularly high risk of a severe case of COVID - 19 . In Germany , 43 % of the population has this blood type . In the event of coronavirus infection , these individuals might be two times more likely to need an oxygen supply or respir@@ ator than people with blood type O : 41 % of Germany 's population .
Blood type O may be able to consider themselves lucky as things stand . Even though they are not protected against an infection , the study shows they have the lowest risk of coming down with a severe case of the disease .
People with blood type O - ( O negative ) also play a special role as blood donors , as they are considered " universal donors " and can help anyone in need of a blood transfusion .
Blood types B and A@@ B are not as widespread , making up just 11 % and 5 % of the population , respectively . According to the study , the likelihood of a severe COVID - 19 diagnosis for these groups could lie somewhere between that of people with blood types O or A.
Since then , further studies have been added to confirm the original results . On 14 October , two studies appeared in the journal Blood Advan@@ ces , which also show less severe symptoms of the disease in people in blood group O@@ . Sim@@ ul@@ taneously , the Medical University of Gra@@ z independently reported a series of experiments , designed to further investigate the phenomenon .
Con@@ sequences for treatment
The results of the studies may help in developing various drug treatments . Researchers have used similar approaches when searching for medication to fight other diseases .
In the case of malaria , for example , scientists have established a link between the disease and different blood types . For example , it is now known that people with blood type O very rarely develop severe malaria and are very well - protected against its most severe form .
In the case of other diseases , other blood types protect the human body best . For example , with the bub@@ onic plague , people with blood type A showed the mil@@ dest symptoms .
For a long time , COVID - 19 research focused on high - risk patients : Those who have certain pre@@ existing conditions and / or have reached a certain age . Smo@@ kers also came under scrutiny as a potentially high - risk group . Now , researchers are looking at a different piece in the coronavirus j@@ ig@@ saw puzz@@ le .
Coronavirus : France 's Macron announces cur@@ few for Paris and Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a late night cur@@ few for residents in Paris , Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le and seven other cities . The government also moved to re@@ in@@ state its COVID - 19 state of health emergency .
French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Wednesday that locals in Paris and eight other cities will have to stick to a cur@@ few from 9@@ :00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m.
The restriction , which will come into force on Saturday and last for at least four weeks , will mean residents will not be able to go to restaurants or private homes during these hours .
Macron said on national television : " We have to act . We need to put a br@@ ake on the spread of the virus . "
In addition to Paris and the region surrounding it , the new measures also targeted the cities of Gre@@ noble , L@@ il@@ le , Lyon , Mar@@ se@@ il@@ le , Mont@@ pel@@ lier , Rouen , Saint - E@@ ti@@ en@@ ne and T@@ oul@@ ouse .
" We wo n't be leaving the restaurant after 9@@ :00 p.m. , " Macron said . " We wo n't be part@@ ying with friends because we know that that 's where the contamination risk is greatest . "
Anyone found to be trans@@ gres@@ sing the new rules will face a fine of € 135 ( $ 159 ) .
" We are in a worrying situation , " he continued , while ins@@ isting France had not " lost control " of the virus .
The new measures are intended to curb the spread of the virus in France and get a gri@@ p on a recent surge in new cases .
On Wednesday , health authorities announced more than 9,@@ 100 patients were currently in hospital being treated for COVID - 19 , the highest figure since June 25 , leading some experts to suggest the country 's medical system is on the verge of being overwhelmed .
State of emergency
Shortly before the cur@@ few was announced , the French government moved to re@@ in@@ state a public health state of emergency in a bid to curb an up@@ tick in coronavirus infections across the country .
The formal declaration was made in a statement by the government , adding that the pandemic was a public health disaster which endangered the well - being of the entire population .
France was facing " a health catastro@@ phe , " according to minutes from a Cabinet meeting that took place on Wednesday .
The state of health emergency is a legal framework allowing the government to take a stricter line on fighting the spread of infections .
Earlier this year France declared a state of health emergency which expired on July 10 .
Coronavirus drugs : Can antibodies from survivors help ?
Aside from a Covid - 19 vaccine , antibodies from recovered patients could provide a short - term " passive immunization " to the disease . A German immuno@@ logist saved thousands of lives with the method 100 years ago .
About 80,000 people worldwide have survived a Covid - 19 infection . Their immune systems will have produced antibodies , which will help their bodies recognize and fight a repeat attack by the coronavirus . It 's a natural defense mechanism .
But while we wait for a vaccine to prevent infection , those antibodies could be used to help those infected .
Those antibodies can be extrac@@ ted from the blood ser@@ um of survi@@ ving patients , and then injected into infected people . Those people should then develop a " passive immunity . "
Advan@@ t@@ ages and dis@@ advantages of ser@@ um therapy
A passive immunization functions like a tre@@ am@@ ent for infected patients , but it does n't provide long - term protection . It 's called passive immunization , because the reci@@ pi@@ ent body has n't actively produced any antibodies itself . And as a result , the antibodies it " borro@@ ws " will provide protection or help to fight an infection , but only for a short period of time .
Pas@@ sive immunization usually lasts for a few weeks or months , after which those borrowed or donated antibodies get broken down by the host body within about 30 days .
The person returns to being at risk of infection by the same pathogen , because their own immune system has not been stimul@@ ated to produce its own , more permanent antibodies . Patients who survive a Covid - 19 infection with passive immunization would still be at risk of re-@@ infection , unlike patients who had been infected and fought off the disease with their own immune system actively producing the antibodies .
Nobel Prize for blood ser@@ um therapy
Pas@@ sive immunization was first introduced by E@@ mi@@ l von Be@@ h@@ ring , a German immuno@@ logist and ser@@ ologist , in 18@@ 90 . He developed it for diphtheria , a highly infectious , bacterial disease , responsible for the death of thousands of children back then .
E@@ mi@@ l von Be@@ h@@ ring was awarded the first Nobel Prize for medicine in 190@@ 1 . For his successes in the development of blood ser@@ um - deri@@ ved medicines against diphtheria and tetanus , von Be@@ h@@ ring was hailed by the press as the " sa@@ vior of children " and during World War I as the " sa@@ vior of soldiers . "
U@@ sed against Ebola and bird flu
Serum therapy was used in 2014 at the outbreak of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa .
Four years later , during another outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo , a drug consisting of antibodies was used to treat patients and prevented the virus from spreading in the body . That 's said to have reduced the mortality rate by 30 percent .
Researchers now want to use antibodies extrac@@ ted from the blood ser@@ um of recovered coronavirus patients to offer a passive immunization against the new disease .
And the work has begun .
In Japan , the drug manufacturer Tak@@ eda Pharmaceutical Co. says it plans to obtain an antibody mixture called T@@ A@@ K - 888 from the blood plasma of recovered coronavirus patients and use it to develop a new drug .
Tak@@ eda is also producing a drug called intravenous immuno@@ glo@@ bu@@ lin ( I@@ VI@@ G ) for the treatment of patients with immune disorders . Experts say Tak@@ eda 's approach is promising , as their drug consists of various puri@@ fied antibodies . That means that researchers do not have to spend time and effort identifying the antibodies needed to fight diseases , such as the new coronavirus .
A Californi@@ an competitor , Vi@@ r Pharmac@@ eu@@ ticals , has taken a similar approach . The American biotechnology company is testing whether antibodies obtained in 2003 from the blood ser@@ um of former SARS patients can neutral@@ ize SARS - CoV - 2 .
SARS and SARS - CoV - 2 ( Covid - 19 ) are both severe acute respiratory syn@@ dro@@ mes , so there could be useful similarities in the antibodies .
Vi@@ r is collaborating with W@@ u@@ Xi Biologics , a company in China , where the new coronavirus was first detected . The 2003 SARS pre@@ domin@@ antly affected southern parts of China .
Does ser@@ um therapy replace vaccination ?
While drugs to treat patients with Covid - 19 , and vaccines to prevent infection are being developed , a fast - acting , st@@ op@@ ga@@ p ser@@ um therapy could be useful as a first aid for high - risk patients .
High risks groups include older people , around the ages of 70 or 80 , and people with existing , serious conditions , and that may also include younger people .
Experts say an antibody drug could reach a large number of potential patients quickly , because it can be produced quickly in huge cell tanks .
But it will take a vaccine to slow and eventually stop the transmission of this new coronavirus , and lab@@ s around the world are currently working on that at full speed .
Coronavirus : Rem@@ desi@@ vir is no miracle cure
While Rem@@ desi@@ vir reduces the mortality rate and the duration of the illness COVID - 19 , it 's no magic re@@ med@@ y . Now a pre@@ mat@@ urely leaked WHO study confirms earlier research results .
Soon after the very first cases of coronavirus infections in China , att@@ entions turned to Rem@@ desi@@ vir as a potential drug to treat the illness . Rem@@ desi@@ vir was originally developed to treat Ebola infections , but it also showed effectiveness against SARS and MERS coronaviruses in laboratory tests . The new SARS - CoV - 2 is considered a vari@@ ant of the 2002 SARS pathogen .
The drug was developed by the US pharmaceutical company Gil@@ ead Sciences as G@@ S - 5@@ 7@@ 34 . At the out@@ set of the pandemic , it was not approved by any country .
It has since been used in the context of an Emergency Use Author@@ ization ( EU@@ A ) , as well as in the context of scientific studies in numerous countries . Gil@@ ead Sciences gave the drug the brand name Ve@@ k@@ l@@ ury in Au@@ tumn 2020 .
After an initial clinical trial in the US showed positive results in May 2020 , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) granted the EU@@ A . Since then , Rem@@ desi@@ vir was able to be used in hospitals for the treatment of individual patients with the lung disease COVID - 19 outside clinical trials .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) published a non-@@ pe@@ er-@@ reviewed pre@@ print study on Med@@ R@@ xi@@ v on October 15 , 2020 showing that Rem@@ desi@@ vir b@@ arely reduces the mortality rate of COVID - 19 patients . The study is a result of the so - called ' S@@ OL@@ ID@@ A@@ RI@@ T@@ Y Tri@@ al ' in which the data of 11,@@ 266 patients was evaluated .
Gil@@ ead Sciences in a statement argued that by having the study published as a pre@@ print , " the data from this open - label global trial have not undergone the ri@@ gorous review required to allow for construc@@ tive scientific discussion . "
Gil@@ ead Sciences filed an application for regular approval of the drug with the FDA on August 7 , 2020 . It has not yet been approved .
How does Rem@@ dis@@ i@@ vir work ?
The antiviral effect of Rem@@ desi@@ vir deri@@ ves from its function as a so - called n@@ ucle@@ o@@ tide an@@ alo@@ gue . The active substance inhi@@ bits the RNA polymerase ( R@@ d@@ R@@ p ) of viruses such as Ebola and MERS because its structure is similar to RNA building blocks . During virus replic@@ ation , these are er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously incorpor@@ ated into the genetic str@@ ands of the new virus cop@@ ies . Tru@@ ly functional new viruses can not be created in this way .
Although Rem@@ desi@@ vir did not prove to be really effective in fighting Ebola , cell culture experiments and initial experiments on mac@@ a@@ ques showed that it had a promising effect against the coronaviruses SARS and MERS - CoV , which are closely related to SARS - CoV - 2 .
Early clinical trials with Rem@@ desi@@ vir carried out in the US and China were intended to show if the drug also helps against COVID - 19 .
White House celebrates positive effects
Initi@@ al positive results of an early random@@ ized clinical trial in the US were announced on April 29 , 2020 directly from the White House in Washington DC . Speaking about Rem@@ desi@@ vir at a press conference with US President Donald Trump at the White House , the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases ( NI@@ AID ) , Anthony Fauci , then stated : " This will be the standard of care . "
A total of 1,0@@ 63 patients with varying degrees of severity of the disease had taken part in the NI@@ AID - funded study , the " Ad@@ ap@@ tive COVID - 19 Treatment Tri@@ al " ' Ad@@ ap@@ tive COVID - 19 Treatment Tri@@ al ' and were treated with Rem@@ desi@@ vir or a plac@@ eb@@ o for 10 days .
The results were similar , albeit not quite as clear as those from the new N@@ E@@ J@@ M study . According to NI@@ AID , preliminary results suggested that COVID - 19 patients receiving Rem@@ desi@@ vir had , on average , a 31 % faster recovery time than patients given the plac@@ eb@@ o . Patients that received Rem@@ desi@@ vir had an average recovery time of 11 days and patients receiving the plac@@ eb@@ o had an average recovery time of 15 days .
The mortality rate in the Rem@@ desi@@ vir - treated group was 8 % compared to 11.@@ 6 % in the plac@@ eb@@ o group .
Tri@@ als ended pre@@ mat@@ urely
Those responsible for the trials then considered them sufficient . The National Institutes of Health in the US said that the results were meaningful enough . At a meeting of the Data Safety Monitoring Board ( D@@ S@@ MB ) on April 27 , 2020 it was decided to termin@@ ate the study pre@@ mat@@ urely .
In parallel with the successful reports from Washington , there were additional reports from China , where Rem@@ desi@@ vir was first tested for its efficacy in random@@ ized clinical trials in Wuhan on patients in intensive care units suffering from severe cases of COVID - 19 .
Eventually , however , Wuhan l@@ acked the necessary patients because of a sharp decline in new infections , and that study was also termin@@ ated pre@@ mat@@ urely , according to a report in The Lancet .
What do the results mean ?
Both the early two studies , as well as the more recent published and leaked studies , seem to point to the same conclusion : The active substance Rem@@ desi@@ vir has clearly proven to be moder@@ ately effective . It reduces the death rate slightly but not significantly and it reduces the duration of the disease by a few days .
Although this is encouraging , it is far from being the res@@ ounding success that many had hoped for from what was described as the most promising drug candidate to date .
" For patients with a severe form of this disease , this study gives hope that they will be able to recover from the infection more quickly and safely , " he said . " The y@@ ard@@ stick for the effectiveness of potential other drugs will , in the future , be Rem@@ desi@@ vir . "
" The results of the large - scale S@@ OL@@ ID@@ A@@ RI@@ T@@ Y study from the WHO with 11,@@ 266 patients included worldwide are not entirely unexpected , but no less dis@@ appoin@@ ting " C@@ lem@@ ens W@@ end@@ t@@ ner , chief physician for infec@@ ti@@ ology and tropical medicine at the Munich M@@ unicipal Hospital said .
" Despite the limit@@ ation that no detailed data are available on the pre@@ print server to date and a peer review process is still pending , it can be stated that the study has failed to meet its primary end@@ point : None of the four drugs tested — Rem@@ desi@@ vir , hydroxychloroquine , L@@ opin@@ ar / R@@ it@@ on@@ avir , and I@@ F@@ N - ß@@ 1@@ a - are capable of reducing COVID - 19 mortality in symptomatic patients requiring hospital treatment , " said W@@ end@@ t@@ ler about the most recent study .
How Vietnam is winning its ' war ' on coronavirus
A densely populated neighbor of China , Vietnam has a weak healthcare system and a low budget for combating the coronavirus . So how has it managed to keep its COVID - 19 infection rate so low ?
As the coronavirus pandemic r@@ ages in wealthy European countries , more than 10,000 kilometers ( 6,000 miles ) from China where the outbreak began , Vietnam has widely been spared .
In Germany alone , the latest numbers from the Johns Hopkins University show over 13@@ 4,000 people have been infected with the novel coronavirus , officially known as SARS - CoV - 2 , resulting in more than 3,800 fatalities . Vietnam , which shares a 1,@@ 100 - kilometer - long border with China , however , has only reported 268 infections and no fatalities since the outbreak began in January .
Even if we consider these numbers with a dose of caution , one thing is clear : Vietnam has done a good job thus far in fighting the coronavirus .
During the Tet New Year celebrations at the end of January , Vietnam 's government said it was " declaring war " on the coronavirus , although the outbreak at that time was still confined to China . Premier Nguyen Xuan Phuc said during a meeting of Vietnam 's ruling Communist Party that it would not be long before the coronavirus reached the country . " F@@ igh@@ ting this epidemic , means fighting the enemy , " said Phuc .
M@@ ob@@ il@@ izing on all fronts
However , this fight will depend on a lot of government funding and a st@@ out public health system , which are two things that Vietnam l@@ acks .
Vietnam does not have the capacity to undertake a South Korea - style fight against coronavirus , which has so far involved carrying out 3@@ 50,000 tests . The country 's medical system is also limited . Nguyen Thanh Phong , the mayor of Ho Chi Minh City , a metropolis of 8 million people , said that the city 's hospitals have a total of 900 intensive care beds . An epidemic in the city would easily overwhel@@ m this capacity .
For example , on February 12 , Vietnam put an entire town of 10,000 near Hanoi under quarantine for three weeks . At this time , there were only 10 confirmed COVID - 19 cases in the entire country . Authorities also widely and me@@ ticul@@ ously documented anyone who potentially came in contact with the virus .
Western countries like Germany only documented those infected and their direct contacts . Vietnam also kept track of second , third and fourth levels of contact to infected persons . All of these people were then placed under succ@@ essi@@ vely stringent levels of movement and contact restrictions .
And from very early on , anyone arriving in Vietnam from a high - risk area would be quarantined for 14 days . All schools and universities have also been closed since the beginning of February .
War r@@ het@@ or@@ ic
Vietnam is also applying a kind of war r@@ het@@ or@@ ic in its fight against coronavirus . The premier has said : " Every business , every citizen , every residential area must be a for@@ tress to prevent the epidemic . "
This has hit a nerve with many Vietnamese , who are proud of their ability to stand together in a crisis and endure hard@@ ships . The Health Ministry even sponsored a song on YouTube about proper hand - washing that has gone viral .
Following the rules
Although there are no studies to prove it , the mood on social media and convers@@ ations with Vietnamese indicate that the majority of the public agrees with the government measures .
They are proud that Vietnam is f@@ aring compar@@ atively well in meeting the crisis . The country 's most popular coronavirus fighter , vice Premier Vu Duc Dam , has been celebrated on Facebook as a " national hero . "
There are few people who are bo@@ thered by the fact that this success gives a political advantage to Vietnam 's one - party Communist government , which is accused of violating civil rights . People are also accepting stricter control of the media .
The projected economic costs , which will hit Vietnam hard despite the low case numbers , have also been widely accepted by the population .
According to government figures , 3,000 businesses have closed in the first two months of 2020 . To ease the burden , Vietnam 's government has made $ 1.1 billion ( € 1 billion ) available to pu@@ mp liqu@@ idity into the economy . However , finance officials expect that tax revenues will dry up because of the crisis . The government is also calling for voluntary donations — and people are giving what they can because they believe in their government during this crisis and in the fight against coronavirus .
The immune system 's fight against the coronavirus
A central player in the fight against the novel coronavirus is our immune system . It protects us against the inv@@ ad@@ er and can even be helpful for its therapy . But sometimes it can turn against us .
How does our immune system react to the coronavirus ?
The coronavirus is — like any other virus — not much more than a sh@@ ell around genetic material and a few proteins . To replicate , it needs a host in the form of a living cell . Once infected , this cell does what the virus comm@@ ands it to do : copy information , assemble it , release it .
But this does not go un@@ noticed . Within a few minutes , the body 's immune defense system inter@@ ven@@ es with its in@@ nate response : Gr@@ anu@@ loc@@ ytes , sc@@ av@@ e@@ nger cells and killer cells from the blood and lymph@@ atic system stream in to fight the virus . They are supported by numerous plasma proteins that either act as mes@@ sengers or help to destroy the virus .
For many viruses and bacteria , this initial activity of the immune system is already sufficient to fight an intru@@ der . It often happens very quickly and efficiently . We often notice only small signs that the system is working : We have a cold , a fever .
Inter@@ fer@@ ons are a sub@@ group of sign@@ aling proteins that are normally secre@@ ted by infected cells . SARS - CoV - 1 , which was responsible for the SARS epidemic in 2003 , appears to have sup@@ pressed the production of one of these inter@@ fer@@ ons and thus at least delayed the attraction of immune cells . To what extent this is also the case with SARS - CoV - 2 , the name given to the coronavirus behind the current pandemic , is still unclear . However , inter@@ fer@@ ons support the body 's own virus defense and are now being tested as a therapy in clinical trials .
At a certain point , however , the host response is so strong that its effect can be counter@@ productive . For example , numerous immune cells can enter our lungs and cause the membrane through which oxygen normally passes from the air into the blood to thick@@ en . The exchange of gases is restricted , and in the worst case , ventilation may be necessary .
Sometimes the reaction can over@@ shoot and be directed against healthy cells as well . This could also be the case with the novel coronavirus . So drugs are also being tested that sup@@ press an excessive immune reaction and that are already known from the treatment of auto@@ immune diseases . The balance between protective and over@@ ly aggressive immune processes in dealing with the coronavirus is currently a big mystery . This must now be investigated , says A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f , Director of the Institute of Medical Micro@@ biology , Immun@@ ology and Par@@ as@@ it@@ ology at the University of Bon@@ n .
After a time delay , the acquired immune system finally sets itself in motion . It is different for every person and depends on what we have experienced and with which pathogens we have come into contact . While T cells help destroy infected cells , B cells form antibodies that can keep the virus in check . In the case of the coronavirus , these are neutral@@ izing antibodies that b@@ ind to the sp@@ ike protein of the virus . This is the site of attack of the virus , with which it enters the host , i.e. our human cell . Ne@@ u@@ tral@@ izing antibodies specifically inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ itate the sp@@ ike protein . Our immune system rem@@ embers the antibodies it has produced and is thus prepared for a new infection with the same intru@@ der .
Is there an immunity ? How long does it last ?
The good news is that it is very likely there is an immunity . This is suggested by the proximity to other viruses , epidemiological data and animal experiments . Researchers infected four r@@ hes@@ us monkeys , a species close to humans , with SARS - CoV - 2 . The monkeys showed symptoms of COVID - 19 , the disease caused by the coronavirus , developed neutral@@ izing antibodies and recovered after a few days . When the recovered animals were re@@ infected with the virus , they no longer developed any symptoms : They were immune .
The bad news : It is not yet known how long the immunity will last . It depends on whether a patient has successfully developed neutral@@ izing antibodies . A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f estimates that the immunity should last at least one year . Within this year , every new contact with the virus acts as a kind of boo@@ ster vaccination , which in turn might pro@@ long the immunity .
" The virus is so new that nobody has a reasonable immune response , " says the immuno@@ logist . He believes that lif@@ el@@ ong immunity is unlikely . This " privilege " is reserved for viruses that remain in the body for a long time and give our immune system a virtually permanent opportunity to get to know it . Since the coronavirus is an RNA ( and not a DNA ) virus , it can not permanently settle in the body , says H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f .
The He@@ id@@ el@@ berg immuno@@ logist Ste@@ fan Me@@ u@@ er predicts that the novel coronavirus will also mu@@ tate like all viruses . He as@@ sum@@ es that this could be the case in 10 to 15 years : " At some point , the acquired immunity will no longer be of any use to us because then another coronavirus will return , against which the protection that has now been formed will not help us because the virus has changed in such a way that the antibodies are no longer responsible . And then no vaccination will help either . "
How can we take advantage of the antibody response of the immune system ?
Researchers are already collecting plasma from people who have successfully survived an infection with SARS - CoV - 2 and are using it to treat a limited number of patients suffering from COVID - 19 . The underlying princi@@ ple : passive immunization . The studies carried out to date have shown positive results , but they have usually been carried out on only a few people .
At best , passive immunization is used only when the patient 's own immune system has already started to work against the virus , says A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f : " The longer you can leave the patients alone with the infection before you protect them with passive immunization , the better . " Only through active immunization can one be protected in the long term . At the same time , it is difficult to recognize the right point in time .
PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) tests are currently used to find out whether a person is infected with the coronavirus . With the help of PCR , it is not possible to tell whether or not there is re@@ pro@@ duci@@ ble viral RNA ; it is just a proof of whether the virus is still present , dead or alive .
A PCR test can not tell us whether our immune system has already inter@@ ven@@ ed , i.e. whether we have had contact with the virus in the past , have formed antibodies and are now protected . Researchers are therefore working on tests that check our blood for the presence of antibodies . They are already in use in Singapore , for example , and are ne@@ aring completion in the USA . With the help of these tests , it would finally be possible to gain an over@@ view of the unclear case numbers . In addition , people who have developed antibodies against the virus could be used at the fore@@ front of health care , for example . An " immunity passport " is even under discussion .
Is it possible to become infected and / or ill several times with the coronavirus ?
" According to all we know , it is not possible with the same pathogen , " says A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f . It is possible to become infected with other coronaviruses or viruses from the SARS or MERS group if their sp@@ ike proteins look different . " As far as the current epidemic is concerned , it can be as@@ sumed that people who have been through COVID - 19 will not become ill from it for the time being and will not transmit the virus any further , " he says .
How long before you 're no longer contagious ?
A study carried out on the first coronavirus patients in Germany showed that no viruses that are capable of replic@@ ation can be found from day eight after the onset of symptoms , even though PCR can still detect up to 100,000 gene cop@@ ies per sample . This could change the current quarantine recommendations in the future .
According to the Robert Koch Institute , patients can currently be discharged from hospital if they show two negative PCR samples from the throat within 24 hours . If they have had a severe case of the disease , they should remain in domestic isolation for another two weeks . For each discharge , whether from hospital or home isolation , they should have been symptom - free for at least 48 hours .
Why do people react differently to the virus ?
While some people get off with a mild cold , others are put on ventilators or even die of SARS - Co@@ v - 2 . Especially people with pre-existing conditions and older people seem to be worst - affected by the virus . Why ? This is the hottest question at the moment .
It will still take a very , very long time to understand the mechan@@ istic , biological basis for why some people are so much more severely affected than others , vi@@ ro@@ logist Angela Ras@@ mus@@ sen told The Scientist . " The virus is important , but the host response is at least as important , if not more important , " her colleague Stanley Per@@ l@@ man told the magazine .
Ste@@ fan Me@@ u@@ er sees a fundamental survival princi@@ ple of nature in the different equipment and activity of our immune systems : " If we were all the same , one and the same virus could wipe out the entire human species at once . Due to the genetic range , it is quite normal that some people die from a viral disease while others do not even notice it . "
A@@ chim H@@ ö@@ rau@@ f also suspects immunological vari@@ ants that could be genetically determined . Since inter@@ sti@@ tial pneumonia is observed with the coronavirus , the focus is probably on an over@@ reaction of the immune system . However , it is also possible that each person affected may have been loaded with a different dose of the virus , which in turn leads to different outcomes . And finally , it makes a difference how robust the body and lungs are : Com@@ peti@@ tive athletes simply have more lung volume than long - time smokers .
Coronavirus : How Japan keeps COVID - 19 under control
Despite its proximity to China , Japan has n't seen the massive outbreak of the coronavirus that has shut down much of Europe and North America . What are the Japanese doing differently to help slow the spread ?
Coronavirus concerns were n't on the mind of the many people enjoying Japan 's fam@@ ed ch@@ er@@ ry blo@@ ss@@ oms this past weekend . Thousands of people sat under the pink spl@@ end@@ or in parks and along aven@@ ues , eating their packed lun@@ ches , drinking beer and sn@@ apping selfies with the bu@@ dding blo@@ ss@@ oms .
" Han@@ ami , the flower show , is the most important event of the year for us Japanese , " said an employee at U@@ eno Park in Tokyo .
The contrast to Europe could hardly be greater . Japan so far has 10 outbreak clusters , with close to 1,200 confirmed cases and 43 deaths to the coronavirus as of March 24 . Only a few dozen new infections are reported every day . These figures should have exploded — after all , Japan is very densely populated , with the world 's highest density of senior citizens . And it 's in close contact with nearby China , where the disease originated : in January , some 9@@ 25,000 Chinese people traveled t to Japan , while another 8@@ 9,000 made the trip in February .
Responding to the coronavirus pandemic , the Japanese government closed all schools two weeks before the spring holidays at the end of March and canceled all public events . But shops and restaurants could remain open , and few Japanese employees decided to work from home .
Cont@@ aining the spread
The low numbers of confirmed COVID - 19 cases in Japan initially ar@@ ou@@ sed suspicion that the government was covering up the truth .
" After the Fu@@ k@@ us@@ hi@@ ma nuclear disaster , the government initially refused to admit the reactor mel@@ t@@ downs , " said Barbara Hol@@ thus , a soci@@ ologist with the German Institute for Japanese Studies in Tokyo . " Today , there remains a great dis@@ trust of official statements . "
Despite having the capacity to make 6,000 diagnostic tests per day , Japan has only tested around 14,000 sw@@ abs to date — 20 times fewer than neighboring South Korea , which has been hit hard by the pandemic . Only patients with the most severe symptoms are tested , said Mas@@ ahi@@ ro K@@ ami , a vi@@ ro@@ logist at the Medical Govern@@ ance Research Institute . That , he added , means the number of un@@ reported cases is very high .
Poli@@ tical scientist Ko@@ i@@ chi N@@ ak@@ ano said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe likely wanted to present Japan as a safe country in order not to lose the Summer Olympics
Experts at the Health Ministry have repeatedly rejected such criticism , saying they were looking for sp@@ ik@@ es in COVID - 19 cases in order to contain the virus , rather than conducting widespread tests . When the epidemic broke out in a primary school on the northern island of Ho@@ kk@@ ai@@ do , for example , authorities closed all schools in the prefecture and declared a state of emergency . After three weeks the spread of the virus had been stopped .
" The low number of tests was intended to ensure that health care resources remained available for serious cases of infection , " S@@ eb@@ as@@ tian Mas@@ low , a German political scientist at the University of Tokyo , told D@@ W .
Mas@@ ks ' a part of our everyday lives '
Japanese greeting e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette — a bow instead of a hand@@ shake or a k@@ iss on the che@@ ek — has also played a part in slowing the outbreak , as has basic hygiene education taught from an early age .
" W@@ ashing our hands , g@@ arg@@ ling with a disinfectant solution and wearing masks are part of our everyday lives . We do n't need coronavirus to teach us that , " said a Japanese mother of two . As a result , it was easy for society to switch to anti-@@ infection mode in February when the virus first began to spread . Sho@@ ps and businesses set up hand sanitizers at the entrance , and it became a civi@@ c duty to wear a face mask .
The country typically goes through 5.5 billion face masks every year — 43 per person . Sal@@ es of face masks skyrocketed as the virus took hold . Mas@@ ks have been r@@ ation@@ ed , and people stand pati@@ ently in line waiting for shops to open . Other shops sell stri@@ ps of fabric and coffee fil@@ ters , along with instructions for DIY versions .
The Japanese appear to have understood that a person can be infected without showing symptoms , said Michael Pa@@ um@@ en , a German business manager who has lived in Japan for many years : " You put the mask on to protect others , so you yourself do n't transmit viruses . "
The widespread use of face masks appears to have slowed down the spread of not just COVID - 19 , as indicated by the sharp drop in the number of flu patients in the seven weeks since the outbreak of the coronavirus . A recent study by five Western physi@@ cians , including Fa@@ bian S@@ v@@ ara from the Ca@@ es@@ ar research group in Bon@@ n and Mat@@ thi@@ as Sam@@ w@@ ald from the Medical University in Vienna , found that masks " decrease the transmission of droplets or aero@@ s@@ ols containing viral particles by mask wea@@ rers . "
Apart from social distancing and hand - washing , the experts concluded that face masks could play an important role in slowing down the spread of the virus , poin@@ ting out the low infection rates in Japan .
S@@ low return to normal
In view of this success , Abe last week ref@@ ra@@ ined from declaring a national state of emergency . Since then , the Japanese have slowly been returning to their everyday lives . Tu@@ tor@@ ing schools are back in operation , with the children sitting apart from each other in well - venti@@ lated rooms . A@@ mus@@ ement parks have reopened , but people running a fever are asked to stay away .
F@@ earing a second wave of infections , the government has said that , for the time being , only schools in areas without COVID - 19 patients will be allowed to open at the beginning of the new school semester in April . A ban remains prohi@@ biting large public events .
Foreign visitors , however , remain a threat according to health authorities , with South Koreans and EU citizens barred from entering the country . Foreigners who live in Japan are allowed to return but must remain in quarantine for 14 days upon arrival . According to unofficial information , the measures will remain in place until at least the end of April .
Vietnam records first Covid - 19 deaths
Vietnam has recorded its first Covid - 19 fatalities , in a devastating blow for a country proud of its zero deaths .
The first man , who was aged 70 , was from the central city of Hoi An , state media said on Friday .
A second death , of a 61 - year - old man , was reported later in the day .
There had been no new locally transmitted infections for more than three months , before an outbreak was reported in the nearby resort of Da Nang earlier this week .
Both of the patients who died had underlying health conditions , according to Vietnamese media .
The country , which has a population of around 95 million , has reported just 5@@ 46 cases since the pandemic began .
Unlike many other countries , Vietnam acted before it even had confirmed cases , closing its borders early to almost all travelers , except returning citizens . Anyone entering the country must quarantine in government facilities for 14 days and undergo testing .
And for a while , with no new local transmissions reported since mid-April .
The country received praise for both its timely efforts to contain the virus and for the care it was able to offer .
But earlier this week came the difficult news that new cases had been discovered in the popular resort of Da Nang .
T@@ ens of thousands of tourists from across the country were in the city at the time , many of whom believed the threat from coronavirus had passed .
The government initially closed the city to visitors , before ordering a total local lockdown on Wednesday .
Earlier this week , Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned that every province and city in the country following the outbreak in Da Nang .
" We have to act more swiftly and more fier@@ ce@@ ly in order to control the outbreak , " state media quoted him as saying .
Coronavirus Vietnam : The mysterious resurgence of Covid - 19
In mid-@@ July , Vietnam still sh@@ one as a Covid - 19 out@@ lier . No reported deaths , and months without a locally transmitted case .
F@@ ans packed into football stadiums , schools had reopened , and customers returned to their favourite cafes .
" We were already back to normal life , " said Mai Xuan Tu , a 27 - year - old from Da Nang in central Vietnam .
Like many in the coastal city wil@@ dly popular with domestic visitors , she works in the tourism industry and was slowly resuming boo@@ kings for the tour company she founded .
But by the end of July , Da Nang was the epic@@ en@@ tre of a new coronavirus outbreak , the source of which has st@@ um@@ ped scientists . Cases suddenly surged after 99 straight days with no local transmissions . Last week the city saw the country 's first Covid - 19 death , a toll that has since risen to 10 .
S@@ uc@@ c@@ ess@@ ful response
Just weeks earlier , Vietnam was praised globally as a rare pandemic success story .
The country acted fast and decis@@ i@@ vely where other nations fal@@ tered , closing its borders to almost all travellers except returning citizens as early as March .
It quarantined and tested anyone who entered the country in government facilities , and conducted widespread contact - tracing and testing nationwide .
So what went wrong ?
" I 'm not sure anything went wrong , " says Prof Michael To@@ ole , an epidemiologist and principal research fellow at the Bur@@ net Institute in Melbourne .
Most countries that thought they had the pandemic under control have seen resur@@ gen@@ ces , he says , poin@@ ting to a long list including Spain , Australia and Hong Kong .
Around 80,000 visitors in Danang - many of whom had relaxed into thinking the disease was contained - were flown home promptly after the new cases emerged , as the historic port city se@@ aled itself off from visitors and re@@ treated into full lockdown .
Vietnam 's sp@@ ike shows that " once there 's a little crack and the virus gets in it can just spread so quickly , " Prof To@@ ole says .
Scientists and researchers across the country are racing to find out exactly how it did .
In Hanoi Prof Ro@@ gi@@ er van Do@@ or@@ n , director of the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit , says the source of this latest outbreak remains a " big mystery " .
His team works with the government on its infectious diseases program@@ mes and some of them focus on what he calls " genetic detective work " - the sequ@@ encing of viruses that can help il@@ lumin@@ ate " the chains of transmission . Wh@@ o or where the virus came from " .
But so far no - one knows how the first new case in Da Nang - a 57 - year - old man known as patient 416 - came into contact with the coronavirus .
National pri@@ de
A more likely possibility , say researchers , is that the virus went un@@ detected during the months where there were no reported cases , potentially being asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atically transmitted in the community . Or there could have been an error somewhere along the quarantine process with someone released pre@@ mat@@ urely .
" There 's evidence that the virus was circulating in Da Nang for several weeks before that first case was diagnosed , " says Dr Justin Beard@@ sley , a senior lecturer in infectious diseases at the University of Sydney whose research has focused on Vietnam .
There could be some element of people dropping their guard , he adds , while noting that Vietnam showed excep@@ tionally strong community engagement when it came to curbing spread of the virus .
" There was big national pri@@ de about controlling the pandemic . And I think that 's been missing in some Western countries . "
Since hovering around the 400 mark in late July , the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Vietnam has surged above 7@@ 80 . The deputy health minister has said they expect numbers to rise and forecast on Wednesday that the epidemic will reach a peak in 10 days .
With the recent tourists to Da Nang now back at home , cases have been detected in a total of 14 cities and provinces including the capital and Ho Chi Minh City .
But it has been reas@@ sur@@ ing , says Prof Van Do@@ or@@ n , that all new cases in other parts of the country so far have had a direct link to the Da Nang outbreak . Cru@@ ci@@ ally , there has been no reported community transmission outside of the city and bordering province . This is something authorities will be monitoring closely .
" What was successful before is being done again . I 'm again impressed , " he adds .
' The year we look after our health '
Spec@@ k@@ led among the praise sho@@ wered on Vietnam for its handling of Covid - 19 were some questions about the accuracy of the author@@ it@@ arian state 's data , which medical and diplomatic communities had widely agreed was reliable .
" The new deaths reported shows that there is transparency in reporting Covid - 19 in Vietnam and that previous ' no deaths ' should have not been questioned in the first place , " Dr Huong Le Thu , a senior analy@@ st at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute , tells the BBC .
All the fatalities so far have been older patients with co-@@ mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ties .
In Da Nang residents are read@@ jus@@ ting . The beaches and streets are virtually empty once again as people only leave home to buy food . All eateries have been closed , including for tak@@ e@@ out and deliveries . Flights are gr@@ ounded .
Each resident is set to be tested for the virus , and a field hospital has been erec@@ ted as every resource is thrown at slowing the spread of the disease .
Fre@@ ed@@ oms mostly remain intact in other parts of the country , though Hanoi has closed down bars and karaoke parl@@ ours as an extra precaution , and several cities including the capital and Ho Chi Minh City have made face masks compulsory again in public places .
Like many worldwide , Xuan Tu is rolling with the uncertain@@ ty triggered by the pandemic .
" This year is now the year we look after our health . Fo@@ cus on family . The things that are most important , " she says .
Covid - 19 : Italy tigh@@ tens rules after coronavirus cases surge
Italy has announced a new ra@@ ft of measures to tighten restrictions amid a surge in coronavirus cases .
A mask - wearing PM Giuseppe Conte said the measures were needed " to avoid a new lockdown " .
May@@ ors will get powers to close public areas after 21@@ :00 and the opening times of restaurants and the size of groups allowed will tighten .
The moves came as Italy recorded its highest daily infection rate for the second day in a row .
Another 11,@@ 70@@ 5 new cases were announced on Sunday , beating the previous record , which came a day earlier on Saturday , of 10,@@ 9@@ 25 .
Italy was the European nation hardest hit at the start of the pandemic . It has now recorded 4@@ 14,000 confirmed coronavirus cases . Its 36,@@ 500 deaths place it second to only the UK in Europe .
What did Mr Conte say ?
The prime minister said in a televised address on Sunday evening : " We can not waste time , we must put in place measures to avoid a gener@@ alised lockdown , which could severely compromise the economy .
" The government is here but everyone has to do their part . "
He added : " The most effective measures remain the basic precautions : mask , distance and hand hygiene . We must pay attention to situations where we let our guard down - with relatives and friends . In these situations , the maximum precaution is required . "
How is Europe coping with a surge in cases ?
A number of nations have strengthened their approach to coronavirus as the so - called " second wave " of infections continues to increase .
France saw a record number of new cases on Saturday at 32,@@ 4@@ 27 and there was close to another 30,000 on Sunday .
However , the rise in confirmed cases in Europe has to be set against the vas@@ tly increased testing that is now taking place compared to the first big wave back in March .
Nine major French cities , including the capital Paris , are under a 21@@ :00 to 0@@ 6:00 cur@@ few for at least a month . Anyone out then must have a valid reason or could be fined € 135 .
Switzerland on Sunday re@@ acted to a sharp increase in infections by making the wearing of face - cover@@ ings in indoor public spaces compulsory from Monday . Gatherings of more than 15 people in public are also banned .
The Czech Republic said on Sunday it would wait two weeks before deciding on whether a full lockdown was needed . The country currently has the highest coronavirus infection rate in Europe and has closed most of the hospitality sector and moved schools to distance - learning .
Ireland is set to announce tighter restrictions on Monday . A minister said a loc@@ alised policy had not been sufficient and implied the cabinet was looking at a " level four " approach that would close all non-essential businesses .
Germany hit a daily record of new infections on Saturday and Chancellor Angela Merkel urged people to stay at home and avoid travel where possible .
In the Netherlands , PM Mark Ru@@ t@@ te admitted he should have given better advice to the royal family after they cut short a trip to Greece amid public anger that they were holi@@ day@@ ing shortly after the government had introduced a parti@@ al lockdown .
Where have Vietnamese traveled during the COVID - 19 pandemic ?
Vietnamese people traveled an average of 6@@ 29 km per booking in 2020 .
Since the COVID - 19 pandemic has forced the country to shut@@ ter its borders , Vietnamese holi@@ day@@ makers have had to adjust their 2020 i@@ tiner@@ aries , shifting their plan from overseas visits to domestic destinations .
A recent survey by boo@@ king@@ .com showed the average travel distance traveled by Vietnamese travelers per booking was 6@@ 29 km in 2020 , 30@@ 3 km less than the same period last year .
The survey also showed Vietnamese people are fav@@ oring big cities and well - known destinations , with Ho Chi Minh City , Ha Noi , Vung Tau , Da Nang , and Da Lat amongst the top travel hotspots in June to August .
Anthony Lu , regional director for boo@@ king@@ .com in Vietnam , said Vietnamese people are still busy traveling despite the unpredic@@ table pandemic .
“ Shortly after Vietnam started easing travel restrictions , we found that Vietnamese people , as well as foreigners living in Vietnam , were ea@@ ger to travel , ” Lu said .
Ho Chi Minh City
Ho Chi Minh City is known as Vietnam ’s trade and financial hub .
With a modern and vibrant urban life , the city en@@ thr@@ alls visitors with the es@@ thetic char@@ m of its historical architecture and artistic cit@@ y@@ scape .
Its colorful night eateries and night@@ life venues mean there is always something new and exciting to see .
Travel@@ ers visiting the city are often aw@@ ed by its street eats and wide range of affordable restaurants for din@@ ers of all ages .
Hanoi
Apart from wand@@ ering around the Old Quarter , visitors to Hanoi can enjoy the city ’s dozens of historical land@@ marks , including the Hanoi Cer@@ am@@ ic Mo@@ sa@@ ic M@@ ural , also known as Hanoi ’s Cer@@ am@@ ic Road .
The 3.@@ 85 km road running alongside the Red River was recognized in the Guinness Book of World Records as the ‘ world 's largest cer@@ am@@ ic mo@@ sa@@ ic ’ in 2010 .
For those looking for a qui@@ et place to rela@@ x , West Lake ’s signature cafés offer a peaceful atmosphere with great drinks and snacks .
Vung Tau
Vung Tau is a popular weekend get@@ away for Saigon@@ ese looking to escape the hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le of daily life .
This coastal city is just 90 minutes by bus from the southern metropolis .
Although being famous for its beaches and seafood , Vung Tau has other ' hidden gems ' such as its ligh@@ th@@ ouse and the Robert Taylor Museum of Worldwide Ar@@ ms .
Da Nang
Da Nang offers a fascinating vacation destination filled with many iconic sites like the 6@@ 7m - high Lady Buddha statue at Linh Ung pag@@ oda , known for being the tallest Buddha statue in Vietnam .
Travel@@ ers may also embar@@ k on a luxurious railway adventure aboard The Viet@@ age , a railway line that links the ancient town of Hoi An with the spar@@ k@@ ling sho@@ res of Quy Nhon .
Da Lat
This mes@@ mer@@ izing city is not only famous for its spl@@ en@@ did French - style vill@@ as but also other mon@@ uments and leisure activities .
The cool weather is what makes this Central Highlands city fit for tea farming , perfect for those lo@@ ving to try making their own mat@@ cha drink .
Quarantin@@ e issues hinder Vietnam from operating regular inbound flights
Passengers arrive on a commercial flight from South Korea at Tan Son Nhat Airport in Ho Chi Minh City in this photo taken in September 2020 .
Domestic airlines have once again suspended inbound services , shortly after the resumption in late September
Domestic airlines have once again suspended inbound services , shortly after the resumption of two commercial flights between South Korea and Vietnam in late September .
The suspension is the result of inconsistent management and quarantine protocols for inbound flight passengers , the Ministry of Transport said .
Further guidelines from relevant agencies are needed to restore the flights , the ministry added .
Quarantin@@ e price disputes
Since the country closed its borders since March to prevent the spread of COVID - 19 , Vietnam has still received a handful of inbound flights under three categories - rescue flights , exclusive flights for foreign experts , or commercial flights .
To board rescue flights , passengers must sign up at Vietnamese emb@@ as@@ sies overseas and wait for approval .
Meanwhile , flights for experts and commercial flights do not set any requirements for passengers .
Phan Thanh Tam , deputy director of the Ho Chi Minh City Center for Disease Control , said all entrants into Vietnam are subject to a charg@@ eable quarantine period , excluding those on rescue flights .
The recent arrival of 262 passengers in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City from South Korea marked the resumption of regular commercial flights to Vietnam after previous suspension , a leader of a domestic airline said .
However , the in@@ cons@@ isten@@ cies in quarantine fees at hotels met with a backlash from passengers , he added .
The Southern Air@@ ports Corporation , which manages Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City , reported that there were passengers deliberately picking a quar@@ rel to avoid hotel quarantine in an effort to enter collective quarantine centers , where the 14 - day quarantine service is offered at a much lower price .
Meanwhile , some Vietnam Airlines passengers on September 25 said that they had bought tickets and transferred money for hotel quarantine . However , they were sent to military bases upon arrival at Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi , with their deposits returned by the hotels .
Passengers of budget carrier Viet@@ J@@ et said they should have been quarantined at the hotels in Ho Chi Minh City that they had paid for , but they were sent to centralized isolation in outlying Can Gio District instead .
During his stay in Can Gio after leaving South Korea for Ho Chi Minh City on September 30 , passenger N. T. D. said he had not received transparent information on hotel quarantine fees before buying flight tickets .
Ar@@ ri@@ ving in Ho Chi Minh City , he found hotel charges fluctu@@ ating rapidly and ending up un@@ affordable to many people .
“ Not everyone can afford a stay in a hotel at VND 1.3 million [ $ 56 ] per day , even up to VND 1.7 million [ $ 7@@ 3.3 ] per day in 14 days in a row [ for the required quarantine period ] , ” he el@@ abor@@ ated .
Airline - hotel cooperation
While the quarantine protocols for flight passengers remain under consideration , accommodation and quarantine fees are attributed the recent disruption of international flights .
Many passengers said they could not pay for quarantine fees at high - end hotels in the country .
Nguyen Thi Anh Hoa , deputy director of the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Tourism , said hotels chosen for quarantine services will have to post their rates publicly .
En@@ tran@@ ts into Vietnam are required to present their quarantine plan , including destinations , quarantine facilities , means of transport , and hotel boo@@ kings .
To avoid arising problems , Vietnam Airlines pro@@ poses a partnership between its certified flight ticket agencies and lodging facilities to arrange quarantine tour packages with various options in flight and hotel services .
This will ensure proper quarantine for passengers upon their arrival in Vietnam .
In another note , a working group from the Ministry of Health is developing a uni@@ fied quarantine protocol on a nationwide scale , which will be submitted to the National Steering Committee for COVID - 19 Prevention and Control for approval .
Anti-@@ lock@@ dow@@ ners protest as London COVID alert level is raised
Anti-@@ lockdown demonstrators gathered in central London on Saturday , hours after the British capital moved to the second highest COVID - 19 alert level .
As a second wave of infections gathers pace , Prime Minister Boris Johnson ’s government has stepped up local restrictions in parts of England where cases are sur@@ ging - hoping to shield the economy by allowing the least - affected regions to remain open .
As of midnight , London was moved up to the “ tier 2 ” or “ high - risk ” level . This bans people from meeting any@@ body outside their household or “ support bubble ” - including friends or relatives who help to care for children - in any indoor setting .
The rules also for@@ bid more than six people to meet outdoors , though the police chose not to enforce them as several thousand anti-@@ lockdown campa@@ igners marched down Oxford Street , one of the world ’s bu@@ si@@ est shopping streets in normal times .
The protesters view COVID - 19 restrictions as unnecessary and a brea@@ ch of their human rights . Some oppose mask - wearing and vaccinations .
Some carried plac@@ ards saying : “ M@@ Y B@@ O@@ D@@ Y M@@ Y CH@@ O@@ ICE , N@@ O T@@ O M@@ AN@@ D@@ AT@@ O@@ R@@ Y M@@ AS@@ K@@ S ” .
“ There ’s plenty of things that can kill you , you know , it could happen any day , ” said protes@@ ter Ar@@ ag@@ or@@ n Ky@@ ley , 17 . “ It ’s about living , not just survi@@ ving . We want to be able to enjoy our lives , not just be stuck at home . ”
As of Saturday , 57 % of the United Kingdom ’s population was living under tighter COVID - 19 restrictions .
However scientists from the SA@@ G@@ E group that advi@@ ses the government , and the main opposition Labour Party , want ministers to go further and impose a short nationwide lockdown or so - called “ circuit break@@ er ” for the spread of the disease .
Vietnam canc@@ els 2020 F1 race due to COVID - 19 pandemic
A man wears a protective mask as he guards at the construction site of Formula One Vietnam Grand Pri@@ x racing track in Hanoi , Vietnam March 12 , 2020 .
Vietnam ’s first Formula One grand pri@@ x has been officially cancelled due to the COVID - 19 pandemic , organis@@ ers said on Friday .
The Vietnamese Grand Pri@@ x was originally scheduled to take place in April on the streets of Hanoi as the third race of the season , but sources told Reuters in March that it was under threat .
“ This has been an extremely difficult but necessary decision to reach in view of the continued uncertain@@ ty caused by the global coronavirus pandemic , ” Vietnam Grand Pri@@ x Corp said in an em@@ ailed statement , adding that it would re@@ fund all tickets sold .
Vietnam has recorded over 1,@@ 110 COVID - 19 infections , with 35 deaths , Ministry of Health data showed .
The start of the Formula One season was pushed back to July from March due to the pandemic , with extensive changes made to the 2020 calendar .
The total number of races was cut to 17 from the record 22 originally envisa@@ ged , with Vietnam becoming the 13th race from the original calendar to be ax@@ ed this year .
Hanoi city authorities had hoped to hold the race in November , but Vietnam Grand Pri@@ x Corp Chief Executive Le Ngoc Chi said on Friday that cancellation emerged as the only option after a review of safety criteria .
Formula One only fin@@ alised its 2020 calendar in August , following six rounds of racing .
The 13 races announced before the final calendar was made public were all in Europe , after all four of the season ’s races in the Americ@@ as were scr@@ apped .
In its August announcement , Formula One cancelled the Chinese Grand Pri@@ x , while adding four more races - one in Turkey , two in Bahrain and one in Abu Dhabi - in the last two months of the year .
Vietnamese universities short of international students amid COVID - 19 pandemic
Some international students , among more than 150 ones , take part in the Global Lea@@ der Exper@@ i@@ ence held in 2019 by R@@ MIT University Vietnam .
Many Vietnamese universities are struggling against the falling number of international students because of travel restrictions amid the novel coronavirus ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic .
Normally , local universities admit up to thousands of foreign students each year , who come to Vietnam to take various education programs .
They are po@@ ised to create an ideal overseas study destination in competition with regional universities , but have recently encountered a he@@ f@@ ty obstacle – COVID - 19 .
Every year , the fac@@ ulty of Vietnamese studies of the University of Social Sciences and Hum@@ an@@ ities , Vietnam National University - Ho Chi Minh City , receives thousands of international students who learn about the Vietnamese language and culture .
According to As@@ so@@ c. Pro . Dr. Doan Le Giang , head of the fac@@ ulty , although this year 's new semester has started , around 50 percent of full - time students , including soph@@ om@@ ores and j@@ uni@@ ors , have not come back .
They are mainly South Koreans , who returned home in February or March when the epidemic developed complic@@ atedly in Southeast Asia .
Student numbers tum@@ ble
In the new school year of 2020 - 21 , only about 45 new international students were admitted to the fac@@ ulty of Vietnamese studies , dropping nearly a half in comparison with last year 's number .
Most of the fresh@@ men are residing with their families in Vietnam while there are few students from other regional countries .
The pandemic has affected not only full - time students but also those participating in the 2 +@@ 2 program , which means two years in Vietnam and two years in their home countries .
" They could n’t come to Vietnam for the second semester last year and the situation remains unchanged in this year 's first semester , " said Dr. Giang .
The number of exchange students , who often register for a short course from two to three weeks , has also declined sharply , which is quite different from previous years .
Dr. Nguyen Trung Hien , head of student affairs under the fac@@ ulty of international studies of the Vietnam National University - Hanoi , told Tuoi Tre ( Youth ) newspaper it is very difficult to attract international students .
There have been only seven fresh@@ men up to now , Dr. Hien said .
" Although Vietnam has brought the pandemic under control , many international flights have not been resumed , " he added .
" As a result , many overseas students keep a wary eye on traveling to Vietnam for this semester . Some of them are not as excited as before . ”
Dr. Hien 's university received more than 100 students from the U. S. and Canada via student exchange programs last year . The programs , however , have been canceled this year , including study tours and summer schools .
A few international students have met trouble in visa extension , according to Dr. Hien .
In such cases , the university has helped them with entry / exit form@@ alities as requested .
Fl@@ ying students home on charter flights
In 2019 , FPT University admitted about 1,000 international students , mainly via student exchange programs , mostly from Japan , Australia , Malaysia , and Taiwan .
According to Dr. Le Truong Tung , chairman of the FPT University Council , all activities of international training collaboration have come to a standstill this year because of the pandemic .
At the beginning of this year , the pandemic broke out when many international students were participating in student exchange programs at the university .
At the same time , many Vietnamese students were taking part in similar programs in Japan and Malaysia .
As the pandemic could li@@ nger for a long time , the university discussed with its partners and decided to let students return home earlier than expected .
The universities were responsible for the preparation and expenses in bringing students home .
The university chartered a flight to send nearly 100 students and lec@@ turers back to Vietnam from Japan in April , before the restrictions of international flights took effect .
The situation of R@@ MIT Vietnam University , however , did not go as smoo@@ thly as FPT University .
Many of R@@ MIT 's students and lec@@ turers were stranded in Australia for months since the coronavirus outbreak .
It took the university a lot of time to organize a flight carrying 270 students and lec@@ turers from Melbourne to Vietnam , Prof@@ . Peter Co@@ lo@@ e , chairman of R@@ MIT Vietnam , told Tuoi Tre .
All the passengers had tested negative for the coronavirus from 3 - 7 days before boarding .
After landing at Van Don Airport in the northern Vietnamese province of Quang Ninh , they were sent to a central quarantine facility .
" R@@ MIT University Vietnam has been in collaboration with authorities to help our students and lec@@ turers take commercial flights transiting in Asian countries like Singapore and South Korea to come back to Vietnam since the beginning of October , before the start of the new semester , " Prof@@ . Co@@ lo@@ e .
A@@ d - ho@@ c solution : going online
Dr. Giang said his university has offered students full online courses , as only around 50 percent of its international students are living in Vietnam .
Despite some advantages , online courses are not as good as normal classes , he remarked .
Regarding teaching Vietnamese , which is believed to be hard to learn , students can not observe the ways a teacher pron@@ oun@@ ces . This is really difficult for foreign students .
" As a result , lec@@ turers have to send documents to learners who can use them to learn by themselves , " said Giang .
Although FPT University can provide online courses for international students who fail come to Vietnam due to the pandemic , this way of teaching is not as effective as physical classes , Dr. Tung said .
Taking online classes , students will lose the opportunity to experience the Vietnamese culture and society .
L@@ ack of foreign teachers
Many educational institutions in Vietnam have seen a severe shortage of foreign teachers given the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic .
The head of the marketing department of an English language school franchise chain in Ho Chi Minh City revealed that ten of their centers have fallen short of more than 50 foreign teachers .
If Hanoi and Da Nang are taken into account , the system is lacking in nearly 200 foreign lec@@ turers .
Travel restrictions to prevent the pandemic have been considered as the main reason for such a de@@ ar@@ th .
Soc@@ cer super@@ star Cris@@ ti@@ ano Ron@@ al@@ do flies to Italy after testing positive for coronavirus
Cris@@ ti@@ ano Ron@@ al@@ do is returning to Tur@@ in , Italy , aboard a private air am@@ bul@@ ance , after testing positive for Covid - 19 on Tuesday .
Ju@@ ven@@ tus confirmed on Wednesday that its star forward would be able to continue his isolation at home after his flight from Portugal was authorized by health authorities .
According to the head of Portugal 's General Health Direc@@ torate , Gra@@ ç@@ a Fre@@ it@@ as , such movement is permitted given Ron@@ al@@ do , who has residency in Italy , organized and paid for his own private transport .
Ron@@ al@@ do had to submit to an evaluation by health authorities before he left Portugal and sign a term of responsibility . He will be under observation and custody of Italian health officials upon his arrival in Tur@@ in .
" These are international procedures , they are quite well typ@@ i@@ fied , the European Union member states are oblig@@ ated to comply with them , and we comply with them for an anonymous citizen as for a known one , " Fre@@ it@@ as told journalists at a daily briefing on the state of the pandemic in the country .
Cris@@ ti@@ ano Ron@@ al@@ do tests positive for coronavirus
The 35 - year - old Ron@@ al@@ do played for Portugal against France in the Nations League on Sunday and against Spain in a friendly last week .
On Monday , he posted a photo to social media of him sharing a meal with his Portugal team@@ mates .
Following his positive test , the Portu@@ gu@@ ese Football Federation said Ron@@ al@@ do was " well , without symptoms , and in isolation . "
It also confirmed that every other player subsequently returned a negative test on Tuesday morning .
Ron@@ al@@ do is now set to miss his country 's next Nations League fi@@ xture against Sweden on Wednesday , as well as Ju@@ ven@@ tus ' upcoming matches which include a Ser@@ ie A clash with Cro@@ tone and a Champions League group game against Dy@@ nam@@ o K@@ yi@@ v .

George Ram@@ say and Mar@@ tij@@ n E@@ del@@ man contributed to this reporting .
She had a heart attack during lockdown and has subsequently been diagnosed with heart failure .
In July , she was told she needed to have an im@@ plan@@ table cardi@@ over@@ ter de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ator ( IC@@ D ) fit@@ ted , which can shock the heart back into r@@ hyth@@ m when it det@@ ects a potential cardiac arrest .
But 12 weeks on , she is still waiting . " I could have a cardiac arrest at any point , " Sarah says .
" It is aw@@ ful not knowing what is going to happen .
" I am on the urgent list - but the infection rates are rising and the clinics are closing .
" I do n't know when I will get it .
" There are so many people in my position - we do n't have Covid but our lives are at risk too .
" We are the for@@ gotten victims of this pandemic . "
Shar@@ p rise
British Heart Foundation analysis of Office for National Statistics data for England and Wales found almost 800 extra deaths from heart disease among under - 6@@ 5@@ s from March to July - 15 % more than would be expected .
The rate of death was highest during the full lockdown - but , wor@@ r@@ y@@ ingly , the trend continued afterwards .
The charity bl@@ ames delays in people seeking care , as well as reduced access to routine tests and treatments .
And NHS England figures show a sharp rise in the numbers waiting over six weeks for a whole range of key tests , including ech@@ oc@@ ar@@ di@@ o@@ grams for hearts .
BH@@ F associate medical director Dr Son@@ ya Bab@@ u - N@@ ar@@ ay@@ an says the consequences of the pandemic have been " tragic " .
" Covid has put people with heart and circul@@ atory conditions at greater risk than ever , " she says .
And it is essential people seek help if they are worried about their health .
" Do n't delay because you think hospitals are too busy , " Bab@@ u - N@@ ar@@ ay@@ an says .
" The NHS still has systems in place to safely treat you . "
Tra@@ um@@ atic impact
Heart disease is not the only condition affected . Similar warnings have been made by patient groups for other conditions .
Mac@@ m@@ ill@@ an Cancer Support says a drop in re@@ fer@@ r@@ als for urgent cancer check - ups , people starting treatment and the numbers being screened is threatening to have a " traumatic " impact on people 's lives now and in the future .
It is unclear how many lives have been lost for non-@@ Covid reasons .
There were a total of 13@@ ,000 non-@@ Covid excess deaths in England and Wales during the first eight weeks of the pandemic .
Since then , overall death rates have returned to close to normal .
But many more people than would be expected are still dying at home .
An extra 28@@ ,000 deaths in private homes have been recorded since the pandemic started , which is higher than the excess death toll in care homes .
And a third of them were in July , August and September , when Covid death rates were very low .
The Office for National Statistics is investigating the cause .
The numbers dying in hospital have been lower than expected in recent months , so it may just be people are choosing to die at home .
But the Nuffield Trust says it could also be a sign people are going without vital treatment .
The numbers attending accident - and - emergency units dropped by 50 % in April and have still not recovered to normal levels .
Coronavirus : Virus isolation period extended from seven to 10 days
People who test positive for coronavirus or show symptoms in the UK must now self - isolate for at least 10 days , rather than seven .
The change , announced by the UK 's chief medical officers , comes as ministers try to avoid a resurgence of the virus .
Until now , those showing key symptoms - a new continuous cough , a temperature or loss of taste or smell - have had to self - isolate for at least a week .
The new advice is in line with World Health Organization guidance .
The chief medical officers said the change is " particularly important to protect those who have been shi@@ el@@ ding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission " .
E@@ vidence shows that people with Covid - 19 have " a low but real possibility of infec@@ ti@@ ousness " between seven and nine days after falling ill , they said .
People are most contagious just before they first display symptoms and for the first few days afterwards . But scientists say evidence that they could pass it on up to nine days later has " strengthened " .
Ad@@ vice on the length of isolation varies between countries . For example , the Irish Republic says those who have symptoms should isolate for 14 days , while in the US those with symptoms are told to isolate for 10 days and can only leave isolation if they have had at least 24 hours without a fever .
It comes after the prime minister warned of signs of a " second wave " of the pandemic in parts of Europe .
Speaking on BBC Bre@@ ak@@ fast before the announcement , Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to " take a precautionary approach " and " protect people from that wave reaching our sho@@ res " .
Frank A@@ ther@@ ton , chief medical officer for Wales , said the change was " vital " and " nobody should be under the il@@ lu@@ sion that coronavirus has gone away " .
The government has also confirmed that registered health and care professionals travelling to the UK from high - risk countries will be required to self - isolate for 14 days . An quarantine exemp@@ tion for health professionals had been in place since June .
There have also been concerns about several local outbreaks across the UK , including in O@@ ld@@ ham , W@@ re@@ x@@ ham and Stafford@@ shire .
Meanwhile , the government is expected on Friday to announce a decision on whether to ease restrictions in Leic@@ ester , a month after the city was put into extended lockdown following a sp@@ ike in cases .
The mayor of Leic@@ ester , Sir Peter Sou@@ ls@@ by , expressed fru@@ stration at the delayed decision , originally expected on Thursday .
" We have n't got a clu@@ e what 's going on , we really have n't , " he said .
The br@@ akes are beginning to come on
Two or three weeks ago the message from the prime minister was that , hopefully , we would be back to near - norm@@ ality by Christmas .
The direction of travel was one of lockdown easing , with pubs and restaurants reopening , as well as a feeling that we seemed to be getting through it .
Now , there 's a real sense of the br@@ akes beginning to go on .
We saw it with the quick quarantine measures imposed on people returning from Spain . Luxembourg may well have similar restrictions soon and they 're keeping an eye on Belgium too .
We had restrictions imposed in O@@ ld@@ ham to curb the virus there and now there 's been an extension of the self - isolation period .
The real ap@@ prehension is that what is happening in the rest of Europe may , in time , happen here .
To some extent , that has been the story of coronavirus : we have ten@@ ded to follow what has emerged in mainland Europe .
Official figures published on Thursday showed that 43,@@ 1@@ 19 people who tested positive for Covid - 19 in England had their cases transferred to NHS Test and Tr@@ ace since its launch in May .
The tracing system successfully contacted just over 77 % of these - but just over 23 % were not reached .
The figures , from the Department of Health and Social Care , also showed that of 22@@ 2,5@@ 89 people identified as close contacts of those who tested positive , 83 % had been reached and asked to self - isolate .
Prime Minister Boris Johnson 's pledge - that by the end of June everyone tested in person would receive results within 24 hours - is still not being met , with about three - quarters ( 7@@ 6.@@ 4 % ) of people getting results on time in the week up to July 22 .
For those using home testing kits , 7@@ 6.@@ 9 % received results within 48 hours .
But the government is concerned that some people are not coming forward for testing , ham@@ per@@ ing its ability to track outbreaks , because they wrongly think they have to pay for it or that they are not eligible .
A decision that could have been taken months ago
The UK requirement for people who test positive or show symptoms to isolate for seven days was always on the low side - plenty of other countries require 10 days or even longer .
As coronavirus is new , there is still a lack of certain@@ ty over how long someone remains infectious , which is why there are a variety of approaches .
UK health officials say there is enough evidence now to point to a " low , but tangible " risk of transmission from seven to 10 days , even for those with mild to moderate illness .
This is a decision that could have been taken weeks , even months , ago in truth .
But officials are describing it as a " value jud@@ g@@ ement " based on a variety of reasons .
For one thing the easing of restrictions means we have more social contacts than we did previously - so even with the low risk of transmission post seven days , the chances of passing it on increases .
The availability of widespread testing also means only those with a positively confirmed infection need to continue isolating - earlier in the pandemic the lack of testing meant a blanket approach had to be taken so anyone with symptoms was asked to isolate .
But it is about sending an important signal too . Lev@@ els of infection are low , but the message is clear : we ca n't be com@@ plac@@ ent .
The government is launching a TV and online advertising campaign on Thursday night str@@ essing that anyone with symptoms should get tested , which is free and available to all .
Only about a third of people infected are thought to come forward for tests , although some of the un@@ tested cases may be people who do not have any symptoms .
Those in a household with anyone who tests positive or shows symptoms are told to self - isolate for 14 days .
And people returning to the UK from certain countries are also being asked to quarantine for 14 days - a move that has sparked complaints from travel firms .
Ministers are also looking for a way to reduce the current 14 - day quarantine period for arrivals to the UK , meaning that quarantine and self - isolation time periods could be stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed at 10 days .
Mr Hancock told Today that the government is looking at using testing to reduce the length of the quarantine period - but there would be no im@@ minent changes .
On Thursday evening , Luxembourg was removed from the quarantine - free list , meaning people arriving in the UK from the small land - locked country from midnight will need to self - isolate for two weeks .
A senior government source told the BBC that Belgium would stay off the list - for the moment - but case numbers would continue to be monitored .
Leading travel and airline industry figures called on Wednesday for coronavirus testing at airports in the UK but the source said that " any new system had to be work@@ able and at the moment it is n't " .
Mr Hancock told Bre@@ ak@@ fast that the " big scientific challenge " with testing arrivals at the border is that people " can incub@@ ate this disease for many days without dis@@ playing any symptoms , and that would n't show up in a test " .
What are the rules on self - isolating ?
Sel@@ f - isolating means staying at home and not leaving it .
Anyone who has either tested positive for coronavirus or shown symptoms should isolate themselves for at least 10 days , and those who show symptoms should arrange to get tested .
Symptoms include : a new continuous cough , a high temperature , and a loss of , or change in , your normal sense of taste or smell .
They should continue to self - isolate if they still feel unwell after that initial period .
Other members of their household should isolate for 14 days and not leave their homes .
If you test positive you will be contacted by contact trac@@ ers , who will establish who else you might have passed on the infection to .
Any@@ body they de@@ em to be at risk will have to isolate themselves for 14 days from the point of contact .
Australian new@@ sw@@ ire highlights Vietnam ’s success in fighting COVID - 19 resurgence
The convers@@ ation@@ .com reported that Europe could look to the success of countries like Vietnam as the continent is again in the gri@@ p of a COVID - 19 resurgence .
It highlighted targeted testing as an effective t@@ acti@@ c used by Vietnamese health authorities , where they have focused on high - risk individuals and on buildings and neighb@@ our@@ hoods where there have been confirmed cases . Health authorities have also implemented extensive contact tracing , and aimed to identify those at risk of exposure regardless of symptoms .
The country also set up quarantine facilities for infected people and international travellers , minim@@ ising spread inside households .
It noted that having experienced the SARS and avi@@ an flu epidemics , many Asian countries took the threat of COVID - 19 seriously right from the beginning .
In addition , many countries implemented strict mask wearing and physical distancing early . T@@ arg@@ eted testing , education and the involvement of the community are critical in responding to COVID - 19 . / . VNA
Many state - owned groups see big losses amid COVID - 19 crisis
Many enterprises have reported big losses because of Covid - 19 , including large state - owned groups .
The government ’s report to the National Assembly show a sharp decline in tax and fee coll@@ ections as businesses have been hit hard by Covid - 19 . The decrease is also attributed to the policies on tax re@@ missions and tax payment deadline extensions , amoun@@ ting to VND 18.@@ 78 trillion .
“ The tax collection in the first nine months of the year was the lowest in many years , ” the report said . .
The tax and fee coll@@ ections were just equal to 6@@ 1.6 percent of the yearly plan , a decrease of 8.@@ 1 percent decrease compared with the same period last year . Meanwhile , in previous years , the coll@@ ections of the first nine months of 2016 - 2019 were 6@@ 9.7 - 72 percent of the yearly plans and the coll@@ ections increased by 7 - 15.@@ 2 percent year after year .
Covid - 19 , which has seriously affected China , the US and Europe , the biggest partners of Vietnam , has also affected Vietnam trade , especially exports , leading to a decrease of VND 3@@ 5.@@ 279 trillion in state budget collection compared with the same period last year .
The price of crude oil fell to below $ 40 per barrel in the first nine months of the year , causing a considerable decrease to revenue for the state budget .
The government thinks the state budget collection in the last three months of the year will still face difficulties .
The second Covid - 19 outbreak occurred in key economic centers , including Da Nang , Quang Nam , Hai Duong , Hanoi and HCM City . And Vietnam ’s big trade partners have not controlled the epidemic and as a result Vietnam ’s exports and investment will still bear adverse effects .

Covid - 19 vaccines produced by four Vietnamese units – the Vaccine and Biological Production No. 1 ( VABIOTECH ) , the Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals ( P@@ OLYVA@@ C ) , the Institute of Vaccines and Medical Biologicals ( I@@ VA@@ C ) , and the Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology – have shown positive initial results .
Nanogen Research and Development Director Do Minh Si said that the company has succeeded in making four kinds of single - chain vari@@ able fr@@ ag@@ ment ( sc@@ F@@ v ) antibodies based on Covid - 19 recovered patients ’ antibodies .
M@@ enti@@ oning on pre-@@ clinical trial studies of four kinds of single - chain vari@@ able fr@@ ag@@ ment antibodies , Director Si said Nanogen has resear@@ ched and it can now produce sc@@ F@@ v antibodies and per - sc@@ F@@ v antibodies against R@@ B@@ D of SARS - CoV - 2 virus . The company can make 10,000 doz@@ es a week .
According to Director Si , the company has spent VND@@ 120 billion ( US$ 5,@@ 17@@ 7,@@ 7@@ 79 ) including VND@@ 75 billion for clinical studies and the remaining for upgrade of its facility and equipment .
Deputy Head of the Ministry of Health ’s Department of Technology Science and Training Nguyen Ngo Quang affirmed that the Ministry will effort to help the Nanogen Pharmaceutical Biotechnology to finish preclinical trial as soon as possible .
He noted Nanogen to finish form@@ ality in September or October for human trial .
Chairman advi@@ ses traders to take proactive measures against Covid - 19
Chairman of the People ’s Committee in the Central Province of Thua Thien – Hue advised traders of Dong Ba Market to take proactive measures against Covid - 19 while he and his officials yesterday paid a visit to the market to check the Covid - 19 prevention task .
In a meeting with traders , Chairman Phan Ngoc Tho advised traders to follow the government ’ preventative regulations including not contacting closely with others , wearing fac@@ em@@ asks and not gathering in crowd . Moreover , traders should refuse to sell commodities to those who do n’t wear fac@@ em@@ asks .
Mr. Tho also proposed the market management board to educ@@ ate people about the coronavirus pandemic encouraging traders to adopt preventative measures against Covid - 19 to protect their health and the community especially wearing fac@@ em@@ asks and not gathering in crowd .
Additionally , traders and consumers were advised to install Bluezone , a mobile app designed to assist in contact tracing , in order to better curb the novel coronavirus disease ( Covid - 19 ) outbreaks according to the Prime Min@@ sit@@ er ’s direction .
Furthermore , Chairman Tho asked to renew the market and clean environment around the market ’s premises including planting flowers , ensure security order and handle pav@@ ement encro@@ ach@@ ment .

How new coronavirus restrictions in Paris and London will work
( CNN ) Despite the US seeing a rise in Covid - 19 cases and deaths , Dr. Anthony Fauci says that things would have to get " really , really bad " for him to advoc@@ ate for a national lockdown .
The US is aver@@ aging more than 5@@ 5,000 new cases a day -- up more than 60 % since a mid-@@ September di@@ p -- and experts say the country is in the midst of the dre@@ ad@@ ed fall surge . On Friday , the US reported the most infections in a single day since July . As of Saturday , more than 8.@@ 1 million cases of the virus had been reported in the US and 2@@ 19,@@ 6@@ 66 people have died , according to Johns Hopkins University .
With all the previous and current measures to offset the spread of the virus , " the country is fati@@ gu@@ ed with restrictions , " said Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said during an interview on " 60 Min@@ utes " Sunday night .
" We want to use public health measures not to get in the way of opening the economy , but to being a safe g@@ ateway to opening the economy , " Fauci told CBS News Chief Medical Cor@@ respon@@ dent Dr. Jonathan La@@ P@@ ook during the interview .
" So instead of having an opposition , open up the economy , get jobs back , or shut down . No , put shut down away and say ' we 're going to use public health measures to help us safely get to where we want to go . ' "
He added that it 's not safe yet to say the country is " on the road to essentially getting out of this . "
There is nearly no place in America where Covid - 19 case counts are trending in the right direction as the country heads into what health experts say will be the most challenging months of the pandemic .
Only Missouri and Ver@@ mont recorded a more than 10 % improvement in the average number of reported cases over the past week , according to the university 's data . Cases in Connecti@@ cut and Florida , on the other hand , increased by 50 % or more .
Twenty - seven states saw sp@@ ik@@ es between 10 % and 50 % : Alabama , Ariz@@ ona , Col@@ or@@ ado , Georgia , I@@ da@@ ho , Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , Indi@@ ana , Iow@@ a , K@@ ans@@ as , Massachusetts , Michigan , Minnesota , Mis@@ s@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , N@@ eb@@ ras@@ ka , Nevada , New Jer@@ sey , New Mexico , North Dak@@ o@@ ta , Ohio , R@@ ho@@ de Island , South Carolina , South Dak@@ o@@ ta , Texas , Washington , West Virginia , Wisconsin and Wy@@ oming .
New cases are st@@ atic in the remaining states .
" This really is a har@@ ro@@ wing time , and people have to be careful , " epidemiologist Dr. Ab@@ dul El - S@@ ay@@ ed said .
' This surge has the potential to be way worse '
On Friday , 10 states reported their highest one - day counts : Col@@ or@@ ado , I@@ da@@ ho , Indi@@ ana , Minnesota , New Mexico , North Carolina , North Dak@@ o@@ ta , West Virginia , Wisconsin and Wy@@ oming , according to Johns Hopkins .
As infections rise , so , too , have hospital@@ izations . In New Mexico , hospital@@ izations have increased 101 % this month , G@@ ov@@ . Michelle Lu@@ jan G@@ ris@@ ham said .
More hospital@@ izations will likely be followed by a rise in daily coronavirus deaths , said Dr. Francis Col@@ lin@@ s , director of the National Institutes of Health .
Though the average of 700 coronavirus deaths a day the US remains lower than the daily tol@@ ls of 1,000 in July and August , University of Washington researchers project more than 2,@@ 300 Americans could die daily by mid-@@ January .
" When we saw this kind of transmission earlier on in the pandemic , in March and April , the virus had n't see@@ ded everywhere . ... This surge has the potential to be way worse than it was than either the spring or the summer , " El - S@@ ay@@ ed , Detroit 's former health director , said .
State leaders push new restrictions
Americans can help get the virus under control , experts say , by he@@ eding guidelines tou@@ ted by officials for months : avoiding crowded settings , keeping a distance , keeping small gatherings outdoors and wearing a mask .
" This is a good moment for people to stop and ask themselves : ' What can I do to try to be sure that we limit the further infections that otherwise seem to be lo@@ oming in front of us as cold weather is kicking in and people are indoors , and those cur@@ ves are going upward , in the wrong direction ? ' " Col@@ lin@@ s said Friday .
The up@@ tic@@ ks have prompted state leaders to push new restrictions , including mask enforcement and limits on gatherings , in hopes of curbing the spread .
N@@ eb@@ ras@@ ka G@@ ov@@ . Pet@@ e R@@ ick@@ et@@ ts announced changes to the state 's health measures , including requiring hospitals to reserve at least 10 % of staff@@ ed general and ICU beds for Covid - 19 patients .
In Ken@@ tu@@ cky , G@@ ov@@ . Andy Bes@@ hear said this month he instructed authorities to step up mask enforcement , and in New Mexico , the governor this week ordered new mass gathering limitations and a 10 p.m. closing time for establishments serving alcohol .
" Every New Mexican can and must do their part to stop the spread of COVID - 19 by staying home , limiting their interactions with others , and wearing their masks , " G@@ ris@@ ham tweeted .
Many countries in Europe are seeing another wave of coronavirus infections . Paris and other parts of France have introduced nightly cur@@ fe@@ ws to curb the spread .
The daily tally of new cases surpassed 3@@ 2,000 in France on Saturday . The central area of the capital is bustling with people .
But as the clock strikes 9 p.m. , few people remain . The streets are nearly deserted .
In some areas hit hard by the virus , nightly cur@@ fe@@ ws from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. will stay in place for at least four weeks .
One restaurant in central Paris has started offering dinner an hour earlier than usual . All the customers leave by 9 .
The restaurant owner said , " The number of customers had finally started to recover in autumn , but now we get this shock . I think it is going to be a very difficult time for us and many other restaurants . "
New cases are also rising again in other countries , shooting past levels seen during the spring .
In Italy , nearly 11,000 cases were confirmed on Saturday . It was single - day record . Germany and Poland also reported one - day records .
Belgium will implement a cur@@ few from midnight to 5 a.m. on Monday . All bars and restaurants must stay closed for four weeks .
The foreign ministers of Belgium and Austria have both tested positive for the virus .
They sat next to each other at a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg earlier this month . But it 's not confirmed that the two cases are related .
Virus Res@@ ur@@ gence Se@@ es World Central Bank@@ ers S@@ tick to G@@ lo@@ omy T@@ one
S@@ ign up here for our daily coronavirus news@@ letter on what you need to know , and subscri@@ be to our Covid - 19 po@@ d@@ cast for the latest news and analysis .
Global central bank@@ ers are under no il@@ lu@@ sion that they ’re through the fall@@ out from the coronavirus , issuing fresh warnings about new government restrictions , struggling recoveries and threats to jobs .
Mon@@ etary chi@@ efs from the euro area , Japan and the U. K. were united in their concern about their economies in an online semin@@ ar hosted by the Group of 30 . They all said risks to the out@@ look remain to the down@@ side and sign@@ aled support is going to be needed for some time . Bank of Japan Governor Har@@ u@@ hi@@ ko K@@ uro@@ da even warned that his economy is at risk of a recession if things turn s@@ our .
“ Japan is likely to follow an improving trend . However , this out@@ look is highly un@@ certain , ” he said . “ If growth expectations drop and the financial system becomes unstable , the economy could fall into a full - fle@@ d@@ ged recession . ”
2020 GDP Fore@@ cast
While the situation across advanced economies is sha@@ ky , Europe ’s out@@ look has been particularly d@@ ented by new cur@@ bs imposed to contain the spread of the virus . European Central Bank President Chris@@ tine L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de ac@@ knowled@@ ged that point head on , saying the measures could further hinder a recovery that ’s already started to f@@ ade .
“ The recovery in the euro area remains un@@ certain , uneven and in@@ complete , ” she told her colleagues . “ The new coronavirus - related restrictions currently being introduced across Europe will add to uncertain@@ ty for firms and households . ”
The measures announced last week include a French cur@@ few in Paris and other cities , while outside the euro zone , the U. K. imposed new rules on gatherings . Italy , which hit a daily record of virus cases Sunday , may impose more cur@@ bs this week . Ireland is considering health authorities ’ recommendation to move the nation to the tigh@@ test lockdown level .
L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de also discussed an additional worry , which is the dramatic destruction of work from the pandemic . She highlighted that the situation has been worsened because of the greater damage in “ job rich ” services , which account for almost 75 % of employment in euro - area countries .
Comp@@ ounding that , the services recovery will be slower because it does n’t benefit like dur@@ able - goods manufacturing does from p@@ ent - up demand .
“ The car that you did not buy in March you are going to buy in September , ” she said . “ But the vacation you could not take in March , you are not going to take in October . ”
From the Bank of England , Governor Andrew Bailey echo@@ ed that tone , saying there ’s an “ unprecedented level of economic uncertain@@ ty , ” noting in particular the recent resurgence of virus cases .
He said the risks remain “ very heavily s@@ ke@@ wed toward the down@@ side . ”
“ To borrow a phr@@ ase from sports , I ’m afraid the hard y@@ ards in are still to come , ” he said .
EC@@ B ’s L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de S@@ ays Virus Cur@@ bs Will Bol@@ ster Economic Un@@ certain@@ ty
Pand@@ emic impact on services is of particular concern , she says .
L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de says recovery remains in@@ complete , uneven , un@@ certain .
New restrictions being rolled out across the euro area to curb the surge of infections will increase uncertain@@ ty for companies and families , European Central Bank President Chris@@ tine L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de said .
The lo@@ p - sided impact that the pandemic has on services is particularly worrying as the sector accounts for 75 % of employment in the 19 - nation region , she said . That may slow the recovery and increase inequality .
“ The recovery remains un@@ certain , uneven and in@@ complete , ” L@@ ag@@ ar@@ de told a panel discussion with heads of central banks from the U. K. , China and Japan . “ It is clear that both f@@ is@@ cal support and monetary policy support have to remain in place for as long as necessary and ‘ cliff effects ’ must be avoided . ”
The re@@ marks under@@ score policy makers ’ growing concern about the pace of recovery . W@@ ea@@ ker spending on consumer goods in the summer months suggested that there is n’t much p@@ ent - up demand , meaning sales lost are unlikely to be made up at a later point .
L@@ ess than two weeks before the EC@@ B ’s next policy meeting , the out@@ look for the euro - area has been growing rapidly worse after countries imposed cur@@ fe@@ ws and other restrictions to stop the spread of the virus .
While officials have reasons to delay a decision on increasing their 1.@@ 35 trillion euro ( $ 1.6 trillion ) emergency bond - buying program , Executive Board member F@@ abi@@ o Pan@@ et@@ ta said on Saturday new cur@@ bs put the recovery further from reach .
Covid Cases Ex@@ tend ‘ Tr@@ ou@@ bling ’ Sur@@ ge , S@@ ign@@ aling More D@@ ea@@ ths
A medical staff member per@@ forms a Covid - 19 test in F@@ argo , North Dak@@ o@@ ta .
The number of daily Covid - 19 cases is continuing its stea@@ dy climb as temperatures begin to di@@ p across the U. S. , students return to classrooms and more people stay indoors where the virus spreads easily .
While far fewer people are ending up hospitalized with the illness than during the pandemic ’s surge in March and April , many more deaths are expected to be added to almost 2@@ 18@@ ,000 already reported nationally as cases sp@@ ike , experts said .
“ If you take a look from 30,000 feet , most states have rising case numbers , ” with no down@@ ward trends to be seen , said William Sch@@ aff@@ ner , an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nash@@ ville , Tennessee . “ That is trou@@ bling as winter approaches . ”
N@@ ation@@ ally , seven - day moving case aver@@ ages have climbed to their highest in two months , while the number of currently hospitalized Covid - 19 patients was the most since Aug@@ . 27 , according to Johns Hopkins University and Covid Tr@@ acking Project data .
The seven - day average of deaths due to Covid - 19 is still at about a third of peak levels in April , but a decline that took place over recent weeks appears to have stopped . Repor@@ ted deaths often la@@ g behind other numbers by several weeks , said Sch@@ aff@@ ner , so those numbers will likely follow the rising number of cases and hospital@@ izations .
Rural Sur@@ ges
“ All of us anticip@@ ate Covid is going to increase this winter , ” he said .
Ho@@ pes that warm summer weather might tam@@ p down spread were fru@@ str@@ ated by outbreaks in Sun B@@ elt states . Since then , there ’s been a surge of cases in the U@@ pper Mid@@ west and on college cam@@ p@@ uses across the country . The highest case rates per capita in the past seven days have been in North Dak@@ o@@ ta , South Dak@@ o@@ ta , Mont@@ ana , Wisconsin and U@@ ta@@ h . South Dak@@ o@@ ta leads the nation in Covid - 19 hospital@@ izations per capita .
Those trends , and similar increases across Europe , are cause for alarm , said New York City Mayor Bill De B@@ las@@ i@@ o .
“ It ’s absolutely trou@@ bling to see how far these places are falling backwards , ” he said Friday in an appearance on W@@ N@@ Y@@ C radio . “ We ca n’t allow that to happen here . ”
While the initial surge of the virus hit densely populated urban areas , it ’s now overwhelming rural regions , suburbs and small cities . Based on the seven - day rolling average of new cases , New Mexico , Missouri , South Dak@@ o@@ ta , Michigan and Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is have seen the biggest increases in the past week , by percentage .
“ Overall , it ’s looking gri@@ m to see the infections on the rise and the hospital@@ izations tracking with that , ” said E@@ ric To@@ pol , director of the S@@ cri@@ pp@@ s Tran@@ sl@@ ational Research Institute in La J@@ ol@@ la , California .
Daily Cases P@@ er 100,000 by Urban - Rural C@@ las@@ si@@ fication
The growing number of daily cases is a key indic@@ ator of the virus ’s nationwide spread . With holiday soci@@ alizing , influenza and winter weather all on the hor@@ iz@@ on , the increased number of hospital@@ izations is also cause for concern that the health - care system may soon be overwhelmed once again in certain areas .
In@@ deed , hospitals in the U@@ pper Mid@@ west hot spots are reporting their resources stret@@ ched and having to send patients to hospitals hours away or even in other states . With the pathogen now more en@@ tr@@ en@@ ched in the population , winter ’s surge could be worse than the first .
“ We are arriving at the Covid - 19 perfect storm , ” said Michael O@@ ster@@ hol@@ m , director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota . The current increases are only the start of a long winter ahead , he said .
Im@@ proved Treatment
One bright spot , O@@ ster@@ hol@@ m said , is that hospitals have become far more ad@@ ept and have more tools available to treat the virus . Medicines like Gil@@ ead Sciences Inc. ’s remdesivir and gener@@ ic steroid d@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one , both given to President Donald Trump after he was diagnosed , are helping people recover .
In@@ cre@@ ased testing is also cat@@ ching more cases early . The Trump administration announced last month that it would distribute 150 million rapid tests made by Ab@@ bot@@ t Labor@@ atories for use in nursing homes , schools , and hard - hit minority populations .
U. S. Current Covid - 19 Hospit@@ al@@ izations
Diagno@@ stics manufacturers are now shipping more than 1.4 million tests nationwide each day , up from 600,000 at the start of May , according to Ad@@ va@@ M@@ ed , a trade group for the medical - technology industry . To@@ tal shipments have surpassed 190 million tests .
But even states that not long ago appeared to be doing well have seen resur@@ gen@@ ces . In New York City , schools shut@@ tered in several neighborhoods shortly after reopening after a sp@@ ike in cases in those areas .
“ We ’re just getting started , ” said O@@ ster@@ hol@@ m , “ And how bad it ’s going to be is dependent on how the population respon@@ ds . Right now , up to a third of the public does n’t believe this is real ; they believe it ’s a ho@@ a@@ x . ”
Coronavirus vaccine : Is Chil@@ e@@ an tree bar@@ k a key ingredient ?
The qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , which grows in the Chil@@ e@@ an An@@ des , has traditionally been used by the M@@ ap@@ u@@ che to treat col@@ ds and inflammation . But it could play a significant role in a vaccine for the novel coronavirus .
The Chil@@ e@@ an bio@@ tech company Desert King is a significant actor in the race to develop a COVID - 19 vaccine . The firm has developed a procedure that allows for active agents to be extrac@@ ted from the bar@@ k and wood of the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , which only grows in Chile . Desert King sells the resulting powder to a British subsidiary of the US vaccine development company Nov@@ ov@@ a@@ x .
Nov@@ ov@@ a@@ x announced in late September that it had initiated its first Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of its vaccine in the UK , and that it aimed to enroll 10,000 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 84 to take part . Currently , there are 11 COVID - 19 vaccine candidates in the third phase of testing .
Desert King General Man@@ ager An@@ d@@ res Gonz@@ ales told D@@ W that if all went well , production of the vaccine could start early next year .
Multi@@ purpose fo@@ aming agents
" A vaccine is comp@@ ris@@ ed of two elements , an antigen and an adju@@ v@@ ant , " explained Gonzal@@ ez . " The antigen activ@@ ates a body 's own defense , while the adju@@ v@@ ant helps release the antigen into the cells and also stimul@@ ates the body 's immune response . "
The qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , also known as the soap bar@@ k tree , has a high content of sa@@ pon@@ ins , which are natural em@@ ul@@ si@@ fiers and multi@@ purpose fo@@ aming agents . They can be used to b@@ ind substances that usually do not mix , such as water and oil , but they can also serve as adju@@ v@@ ants .
After conducting studies into the 50 odd sa@@ pon@@ ins contained in the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , Desert King identified two substances — Q@@ S@@ 7 and Q@@ S@@ 21 — that could function as an adju@@ v@@ ant in a potential vaccine .
" We are already producing industrial quantities of qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja for Nov@@ av@@ a@@ x , " said Gonzal@@ ez .
The qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree can grow up to 20 meters ( 65 feet ) high ; its trunk can reach a diameter of 1.5 meters . It flowers from October to January , producing an ar@@ om@@ atic hon@@ ey . The ever@@ green , with smooth and lea@@ ther@@ y leaves , has small , yellow@@ ish - white star - formed blo@@ ss@@ oms . With its five fol@@ li@@ cles , the woo@@ dy fruit of the tree resemb@@ les star an@@ ise .
U@@ sed in traditional M@@ ap@@ u@@ che medicine
The M@@ ap@@ u@@ che , the largest in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous group in Chile today , have long known about the healing properties of the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree . In their traditional medicine , they use the bar@@ k extract as a dec@@ ong@@ est@@ ant and also to treat digestive problems . They also make a tinc@@ ture from the flowers to treat the symptoms of r@@ he@@ um@@ ati@@ sm .
Qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja can also be used to make a natural sha@@ m@@ po@@ o and the food industry uses it in beer production , for example .
H@@ it by climate change
Unfortunately , the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja tree , which is generally adap@@ table , un@@ demanding and can grow on bar@@ ren land and mountain s@@ lo@@ pes , is suffering from the consequences of climate change , said R@@ ene Car@@ mon@@ a of the Fac@@ ulty of Forest Sciences and Nature Conservation at the University of Chile in S@@ anti@@ ago . " The drou@@ ghts that Chile has been experiencing for 10 years have caused damage to the trees on s@@ lo@@ pes in particular . "
Gonzal@@ ez of Desert King said that the producers of qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja sa@@ pon@@ ins in Chile were keen to work sustain@@ ably . He added that trees would be p@@ ru@@ ned rather than cut down , " This en@@ sures that the trees have less biom@@ ass and need less water so that they can better cope with drought . "
But Car@@ mon@@ a said another major problem was that the tree was often cut down for its wood . He hoped that its use by pharmac@@ eu@@ ticals could help raise awareness about the importance of protecting the qu@@ il@@ la@@ ja trees .
" The fact that an international pharmaceutical company is using this substance to develop a vaccine against COVID - 19 will help us to promote the tree 's importance to people , " Car@@ mon@@ a said . " We hope that people will stop using the tree for fire@@ wood . "
German gl@@ ass@@ maker holds key to COVID - 19 vaccine supply
As the world wa@@ its anx@@ iously for a COVID - 19 vaccine , a German company is doing its bit to ensure that the shot reaches you with its po@@ ten@@ cy intact . A@@ shu@@ to@@ sh Pan@@ de@@ y reports from its Main@@ z headquarters .
It 's lun@@ ch@@ time at S@@ cho@@ tt 's sp@@ ra@@ wling campus in Main@@ z , home to the gl@@ ass@@ maker 's headquarters and pharma glass - tu@@ bing production unit . The can@@ teen is bu@@ z@@ zing with employees , many of them re@@ lishing the meal … as well as some sun ; on - site dining made a com@@ eb@@ ack just a few weeks back after being stopped at the height of the pandemic .
A tow@@ ering red chimney of one of the plants over@@ looks the outdoor dining area , where the tables are even@@ ly spac@@ ed out in line with social distancing norms . All tables are occupied , but con@@ spic@@ uous by their absence are the tu@@ bing plant staff , otherwise difficult to miss in their blue uni@@ forms . I am told that 's because the lunch hours have been divi@@ ded into s@@ lots to check the spread of the coronavirus by minimizing contact between one set of employees and the other .
The strategy , along with other safety measures like a ban on visitors entering the production plants , seems to have worked so far . S@@ cho@@ tt has managed to keep production running at its facility without any disrup@@ tions , even when the virus was wre@@ aking ha@@ voc in the region in spring .
The critical pharma tu@@ bing plant produces one - and - a-@@ half meter - long glass tubes , which are used to make pharma vi@@ als at the company 's plant in Mül@@ l@@ h@@ ei@@ m , a small town about 300 kilometers ( 186 miles ) south of Main@@ z in one of Germany 's most industri@@ alized states of B@@ ad@@ en - W@@ ü@@ r@@ tt@@ emb@@ er@@ g .
The 130 - year - old firm , whose glass is used in products ranging from cooking tops to telescopes , has committed to supply enough vi@@ als to hold up to 2 billion doses of COVID - 19 vaccines .
S@@ cho@@ tt , which has already supplied millions of vi@@ als to COVID - 19 vaccine makers , says it 's well - placed to boost capacity at its production facilities , including in the US and Germany , to produce vi@@ als for another 1 billion doses . It is estimated that the world would need some 15 billion doses , as@@ sum@@ ing the successful vaccine is a twin - dose vaccine .
" We have a one - time chance to be part of the solution . We know that there are hundreds of vaccines being currently developed and we know that all those vaccines will need the packaging and S@@ cho@@ tt is prepared to provide that packaging , " said Fa@@ bian St@@ ö@@ ck@@ er , head of Strate@@ gy and Innovation at S@@ cho@@ tt 's pharma unit . " It 's very motiv@@ ating and a good feeling to be a part of efforts to get rid of this pandemic . "
Governments , firms , and international organizations across the globe are spending billions of dollars to launch mass production of yet - to - be@@ -@@ approved vaccines and to boost supply chain capabilities , making sure they are not caught off guard once the vaccines are given the green light .
Wh@@ o will get the coronavirus vaccine first ?
S@@ cho@@ tt , which is@@ owned by the Carl Z@@ e@@ iss Foundation — the owner of the ep@@ onymous l@@ ens maker , is using bor@@ o@@ sil@@ ic@@ ate glass to make the vi@@ als . The glass , inv@@ ented by S@@ cho@@ tt founder O@@ t@@ to S@@ cho@@ tt , is often referred to as the gold standard for drug packaging , thanks to its extreme resistance to heat and chemicals and its iner@@ t@@ ness and density .
The glass is made using sand , chemicals , including sodium oxide and bor@@ ic oxide , and crushed , recycled bor@@ o@@ sil@@ ic@@ ate glass , which is usually a le@@ f@@ tover from the glass - making process . The mixture is then put in a fur@@ n@@ ace , which burns at around 1,@@ 550 degrees Celsius . Inside the fur@@ n@@ ace , known as a tu@@ bing tank , there are three cham@@ bers and several bur@@ ners , which m@@ elt the mixture . All imp@@ urities are removed using chlor@@ ine gas before the liquid glass is drawn into tubes by robots .
The company says bor@@ o@@ sil@@ ic@@ ate glass is best su@@ ited for potential COVID - 19 vaccines , as it avo@@ ids the interactions between containers and vaccines that can hurt the shot 's po@@ ten@@ cy .
S@@ cho@@ tt has struck deals with several leading vaccine makers , including India 's Serum Institute , the world 's largest vaccine maker by volume , and partners of Operation War@@ p Spe@@ ed — a public - private partnership initiated by the Trump administration to accelerate vaccine development .
The company is supplying vi@@ als to three out of four of all COVID - 19 vaccine candidates in Phase I , II , or III , St@@ ö@@ ck@@ er said , adding that S@@ cho@@ tt was in talks with the other pharma companies to as@@ certain the size of the vi@@ als needed .
" At this point in time , it is not fully clear what kind of packaging would be needed . It is clear we would need a glass vial , but in some cases it 's not clear what format would it be . Is it going to be a two - m@@ ill@@ il@@ iter format or a 10 - m@@ ill@@ il@@ iter format ? That would depend on how the vaccine is going to be administered later . Will it be a single shot or a multiple - dose vaccine , " St@@ ö@@ ck@@ er told D@@ W .
The company is benefiting from its $ 1 billion expansion plan launched last year as it looks to meet the increasing demand for glass vi@@ als . It plans to spend half that amount by the end of next year . The company is also pump@@ ing in additional cash on new production lines .
A united front against COVID - 19
S@@ cho@@ tt 's rivals , Ger@@ re@@ she@@ im@@ er and St@@ ev@@ an@@ a@@ to Group , are also investing in boosting their capabilities . The three gl@@ ass@@ makers produce billions of bor@@ o@@ sil@@ ic@@ ate glass vi@@ als every year — the type that would be needed for COVID - 19 vaccines .
" The virus is not holding back at the German border , nor at the US or the Chinese or Indian border , " St@@ ö@@ ck@@ er told D@@ W . " People realize that it 's a global problem and that we need a global answer to it . That has driven all the players in the industry to work together , putting their competitive thinking a little bit aside . "
Coronavirus vaccine producers pledge to follow normal rules , as one key trial is pa@@ used
German vaccine maker Bio@@ N@@ Tech and eight bio@@ tech companies have vowed to follow safety measures before rolling out vaccines . AstraZeneca has suspended one trial after " a potentially un@@ explained illness " in a participant .
Several companies developing vaccines to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic on Tuesday pledged to " uph@@ old the integr@@ ity of the scientific process " amid growing concerns they could succum@@ b to political pressure .
" We , the under@@ signed bio@@ pharmaceutical companies , want to make clear our ongoing commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID - 19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles , " said the chief executives of AstraZeneca , Bio@@ N@@ Tech and Moderna , among others .
Public health authorities have tou@@ ted a successful vaccine as the only re@@ med@@ y to the deadly pathogen , which has infected 28 million people and left nearly one million others dead across the globe .
The companies said they would only seek emergency author@@ izations for their vaccines " after demonstr@@ ating safety and efficacy through a Phase 3 clinical study that is designed and conducted to meet requirements of expert regulatory authorities . "
Earlier this year , the US Food and Drug Ad@@ ministr@@ ator ( FDA ) approved the use of hydroxychloroquine and blood plasma to treat coronavirus patients , triggering a backlash from experts who argued there was not sufficient scientific evidence to prove their safe efficacy . The FDA re@@ versed these decisions shortly after .
The race for a vaccine
Oxford / AstraZeneca trial on hold
AstraZeneca , one of the co-@@ sig@@ ners of the open pledge , told a US outlet that trials of their vaccine candidate were temporarily suspended after a patient fell seriously ill .
Dub@@ bed the Oxford vaccine , AstraZeneca 's A@@ Z@@ D@@ 12@@ 22 went into Phase 3 clinical trials — considered the last step before regulatory approval — in the UK , US and Brazil late last month .
" As part of the ongoing random@@ ized , controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine , our standard review process was triggered and we voluntarily pa@@ used vaccination to allow review of safety data by an independent committee , " an AstraZeneca spokesperson told health news website ST@@ AT .
" This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially un@@ explained illness in one of the trials , while it is investigated , ensuring we maintain the integr@@ ity of the trials . "
Brazil 's health authority said later on Tuesday that AstraZeneca had halted the clinical trial and that it was waiting for more information on why , se@@ em@@ ingly cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ating the report in ST@@ AT .
M@@ aking sense of coronavirus infection statistics
At the start of the pandemic , most people focused on the coronavirus reproduction value to assess the severity of the outbreak . Now , the COVID - 19 incidence rate is at the center of attention . What do the two terms mean ?
Until recently , the greatest concern of health authorities was to keep the reproduction number , or R - value , for the coronavirus below the critical threshold of 1 .
If the R - value rises above 1 , this indicates that — stati@@ sti@@ cally speaking — one infected person infec@@ ts more than one other person . Infection rates will thus rise . If , however , the R - value falls below 1 , this indicates that one infected person will — stati@@ sti@@ cally speaking — infect fewer than one person . To contain a virus outbreak , therefore , the R - value must be kept below 1 .
On Tuesday , Germany ’s public health agency , the Robert Koch Institute ( R@@ K@@ I ) , said the country ’s seven - day R - value was at 1.2 . But fewer people are focusing on this indic@@ ator than in previous weeks and months .
Coronavirus incidence
L@@ ately , many decision - makers and ordinary people seem to be paying more attention to the cumulative number of coronavirus infections and illnesses over a certain time period . This so - called incidence is an indic@@ ator of the risk that people will contract the SARS - CoV - 2 virus within a certain time frame .
Germany ’s seven - day incidence rate shows the number of new coronavirus infections — according to positive PC@@ T and antigen tests — within the past week per 100,000 inhabitants .
If too many individuals become infected , Germany ’s regions are urged to impose respective security measures . These may include making masks mandatory everywhere , introducing cur@@ fe@@ ws , banning the sale of alcohol , limiting the number of people allowed to gather in private and at public events , restricting travel and refusing to let tourists from high - risk regions stay in the area 's hotels .
Germany exten@@ ds list of cities under coronavirus cl@@ amp@@ down
Munich became the latest major city to ex@@ ceed Germany ’s key coronavirus threshold . In the capital Berlin , authorities have implemented a night@@ time cur@@ few — the first in 70 years — in response to a dramatic increase in COVID - 19 cases . All Berlin businesses are required to close by 11 p.m. at least until the end of October . The number of people allowed to meet outside at night is limited to five .
What is a sen@@ sible threshold ?
Most regions and federal states in Germany have determined that 50 new coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants signal a serious danger . The southern state of Bav@@ aria has introduced an early warning system : If 35 or more cases are reported within a certain part of Bav@@ aria , regional public health agencies must inform the state 's Health Ministry about the cause of the sp@@ ike and which counter@@ measures are being taken .
The latest coronavirus figures in Germany can be viewed on the R@@ K@@ I 's website .
The 50 - case threshold , which is ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary but not completely without foundation , was set in May to define a critical infection rate .
" This is when public health departments become so strained that they can no longer trace every infection to find out who became infected before , " Frank Ul@@ rich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , who heads the World Medical Association ( W@@ MA ) , told public broadcaster De@@ ut@@ sch@@ land@@ fun@@ k . Once this threshold is exceeded , action must be taken , he said . This , he said , is not being al@@ ar@@ mist but " a sen@@ sible thing to do from a public health perspective . "
The R@@ K@@ I also says this 50 - case threshold is key . On its website , the agency states that " the absolu@@ te number of new infections must be low enough to allow for effective contact tracing to happen and to keep the strain on intensive care units ( ICU ) manag@@ eable . "

Do more tests mean more positive results ?
However , Ste@@ fan Willi@@ ch , who heads the Institute for Social Medicine , Epidemiology and Health Economics at Berlin ’s Char@@ ite hospital , says the 50 - person threshold is out of date . Speaking to public broadcaster R@@ B@@ B In@@ for@@ adi@@ o , Willi@@ ch said a " sen@@ sible reference " was needed to make stati@@ stical sense of the coronavirus pandemic . He said the 50 - person mark per week per 100,000 inhabitants " seemed like a precise indic@@ ator " five months ago , but that in reality , it was little more than a rough indication .
Willi@@ ch said many more people are now undergoing coronavirus tests than in spring , meaning that the she@@ er number of tests will increase the li@@ kel@@ iness of higher recorded infection rates . Con@@ sequ@@ ently , he said , " we are lacking a proper frame of reference . "
Willi@@ ch recommends bas@@ ing our assessment of the extent of the pandemic on representative samples . " I think we will come to a different definition over the coming weeks on the basis of new samples and surveys . "
The epidemiologist says he is certain that safety measures such as masks , social distancing and contact tracing will have to remain in place for quite a while longer .
" These measures are the pillars of our long - term strategy , " says Willi@@ ch , adding that if we practice them , the pandemic will be manag@@ eable . He also says high - risk individuals in retirement and nursing homes , as well as hospitals , must be placed under special protection .
Con@@ stant updating needed
Andreas G@@ ass@@ en , who heads the German National Association of Stat@@ u@@ tory Health In@@ surance Physi@@ cians , is critical of the 50 - person threshold , too . He told the German daily Ne@@ ue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er Z@@ e@@ it@@ ung we should stop focusing on this indic@@ ator , as it spar@@ ks " al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m . "
" Even 10,000 infections per day would not be dramatic , provided only one out of 1,000 people fall gra@@ vely ill — which is what we are seeing now , " he said .
G@@ ass@@ en 's comments came in response to warnings by Robert Koch Institute director Lo@@ th@@ ar Wi@@ el@@ er , who recently said Germany could lose control of the outbreak . G@@ ass@@ en pointed out that in spring this year , Germany recorded some 4,000 new infections and up to 150 deaths per day .
" That is over , and now we are seeing a single - digit death toll , " G@@ ass@@ en said . He said that if this ratio remained stable , Germany could cope even with five - figure infection rates . G@@ ass@@ en does not , therefore , expect the country ’s health care system will collapse in autumn and winter .
Frank Ul@@ rich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery of the W@@ MA has dis@@ agreed . " It takes between four and six weeks before someone dies from a coronavirus illness , " he said . This means , he argued , that recently detected infections only provided a sn@@ ap@@ shot of the situation a week before . A growing number of cases ending in death were to be expected in IC@@ U@@ s only in four to five weeks ' time . " That is why I think it is too early to make such a statement , " he said .
A realistic indic@@ ator ?
G@@ ass@@ en , meanwhile , recommends analyzing which age br@@ ack@@ ets are becoming infected . " I think we can allow for a sense of norm@@ ality to return , provided we communicate sen@@ sibly . " He says that if infections sp@@ ike , quick action could be taken once more .
Therefore he recommends raising the 50 - person threshold per 100,000 inhabitants , which is currently used to classify German regions and cities as coronavirus hotspots . G@@ ass@@ en says this threshold was defined during a time when some 400,000 coronavirus tests were being carried out per week , which produced many positive results . Now , however , testing has been ram@@ ped up to three times this number and many results are coming back negative , he says .
G@@ ass@@ en says a new threshold should take into consideration the significant rate of negative test results we are seeing today . He says based on the current situation , a rate of 84 infections per 100,000 would be a suitable indic@@ ator . But he is of the opinion that the number is unsuitable anyway as a ri@@ gi@@ d and sole indic@@ ator when it comes to imposing rad@@ ical public health measures .

Ass@@ essing travel risks
Germany also applies the 50 - person threshold to determine whether foreign regions classify as coronavirus hotspots . The decision is made based on an analysis by the Health Ministry , Foreign Ministry , and Interior Ministry .
In a first step , the ministries assess which foreign regions or countries recorded 50 or more coronavirus infections per 100,000 inhabitants within the last seven days . Then , in a second step , German authorities check whether regions with lower infection rates could also pose a danger . The updated German list of designated international risk areas can be viewed here ( in German ) .
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , for its part , displays a 14 - day - incidence figure on its website . But the agency warns against compar@@ ing coronavirus infection rates across different EU states , as this data is generated using a variety of different metho@@ do@@ logies . Some countries are mass - testing citizens , while others are not , the agency says . This , of course , has an impact on recorded coronavirus cases .

Traffic - light warning system
In an effort to create more transparency , the EU has introduced a traffic light system to highlight high - risk zones in the bloc . Regi@@ ons with a lack of data are marked gre@@ y .
Red zones den@@ o@@ te regions that either recorded 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and a test posi@@ tivity of over 4 % , or that recorded 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past two weeks .
The warning system is based on the rate of new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 14 days , and the percentage of positive tests .
